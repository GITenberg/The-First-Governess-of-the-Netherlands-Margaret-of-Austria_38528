<p>Transcriber's note: Obvious printer errors have been repaired, but
spelling has not been standardized. Likely spelling errors in the
French poems have not been corrected, as the consulted sources
have the same.</p>

<p>Some Roman numerals are followed by superscript representing ancient units
of weight used in the godsmith's trade:</p>

<p class="i2">m stands for marc<br />
o stands for once<br />
e stands for estelin</p>

<p>Number "83" was somehow left out in the (French) Inventory of

other in the last years of the fifteenth and
the earlier years of the sixteenth century. No betrayal
was too false, no trick too undignified, no
hypocrisy too contemptible for Ferdinand of Aragon,
Maximilian of Austria, and Henry Tudor if unfair
advantage could be gained by them; and the details
of their diplomacy convey to modern students less
an impression of serious State negotiations than
of the paltry dodges of three hucksters with a strong
sense of humour. Of the three, Ferdinand excelled
in unscrupulous falsity, Maximilian in bluff effrontery,
and Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> in close-fisted cunning: they were all
equal in their cynical disregard for the happiness of
their own children, whom they sought to use as
instruments of their policy, and fate finally overreached
them all. And yet by a strange chance,
amongst the offspring of these three clever tricksters
were some of the noblest characters of the age. John,
Prince of Castile, and Arthur, Prince of Wales, both
died too young to have proved their full worth, but
they were beloved beyond the ordinary run of princes,
and were unquestionably gentle, high-minded, and
good; Katharine of Aragon stands for ever as an
exalted type of steadfast faith and worthy womanhood,
unscathed in surroundings and temptations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIII" id="Page_XIII">XIII</a></span>
unequalled difficulty; and Margaret of Austria, as
this book will show, was not only a great ruler but a
cultured poet, a patron of art, a lover of children, a
faithful wife, a pious widow, and, above all, a woman
full of sweet feminine charm.</p>

<p>In an age when princesses of the great royal houses
were from their infancy regarded as matrimonial
pledges for the maintenance of international treaties,
few were promised or sought so frequently as
Margaret; for an alliance with her meant the support
of the Empire and the States of Burgundy, whilst her
two rich dowries from earlier marriages made her
as desirable from a financial point of view as she was
personally and politically. But with her second
widowhood in her youthful prime came to her a distaste
for further experiments in a field where, as she
said, so much unhappiness had befallen her, and of
political marriages she would have no more. Her
one real love affair, to which reference will be made
presently, is pathetic as showing the sad fate of such
an exalted princess, who, being a true woman and in
love with a gallant man, yet had to stifle the yearnings
of her heart for a happy marriage, and fulfil the
duty imposed upon her by the grandeur of her
destiny.</p>

<p>There was little of love, indeed, in most of the
matrimonial proposals made to her, though for two
short periods she was an affectionate wife. From the
time when as a proud little maiden of twelve,
conscious of the slight put upon her, she was repudiated
by the man whom she had looked upon as her
future husband as long as she could remember, and
was sent away from the country of which she had
been taught she was to be the Queen, until her body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV">XIV</a></span>
was borne in state to the sumptuous fane which her
piety had raised, but which she had never seen,
Margaret of Austria knew that a princess of the
imperial house must be a statesman first and
a woman afterwards, at whatever sacrifice of her
personal happiness.</p>

<p>In the great plot of Ferdinand, King of Aragon,
to shut France in by a close ring of rivals, and so to
stay her march eastward along the Mediterranean
to the detriment of the little realm of his fathers, the
first open move was made by the triumphant negotiations
with Maximilian, King of the Romans, and
future Emperor, for the marriage of Ferdinand's only
son, John, the first heir of all Spain, to Maximilian's
only daughter, Margaret; and that of Maximilian's
only son, Philip, sovereign by right of his mother of
the rich duchies of Burgundy, to Ferdinand's second
daughter, Joanna. The matches were cleverly conceived,
for in the ordinary course of events they
seemed to ensure that a band of close kinsmen, all
descended from the King of Aragon, should rule over
Flanders, the Franche Comté, Burgundy, the
Empire, Spain, and Sicily, all banded together to
prevent the expansion of France on any side, whilst
the alliance which the marriages represented gave to
Ferdinand the support of the Emperor as suzerain
of Lombardy against the French pretensions in Italy
generally, and especially in Naples, upon which the
covetous eyes of the Aragonese were already firmly
fixed. The marriage of Ferdinand's youngest daughter,
Katharine, to the heir of England, at a somewhat
later period, was another link in the chain which was
intended to bind France, and give to Ferdinand a free
hand in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XV" id="Page_XV">XV</a></span>
To Maximilian the marriages of his children with
those of Ferdinand was also an advantage, since the
only two enemies that the Empire and Burgundy had
to fear, namely, France and the Turk, might always
be diverted, when necessary, by the action of Aragon
in the Mediterranean. Henry Tudor's interest in
joining the combination against France is equally
easy of explanation. He was a parvenu, anxious for
the recognition of the legitimate sovereigns; and
especially to secure that of Burgundy, which, under
the influence of Margaret of York, the widowed
Duchess of Burgundy, had hitherto supported and
sheltered the pretenders to his throne. But from
the very first each of the three clever players distrusted
the others because he knew that he himself
intended to cheat if he could, and throughout the
whole series of transactions sharp practice is the
gentlest term that can be applied to the action of
the high contracting parties.</p>

<p>The young people who were used by their parents
as pieces on the political chessboard were, of course,
innocent, except the Archduke Philip, who, as soon
as he was able to take an independent hand in the
game, outdid his seniors in depravity; and, as usually
happens in the world, it was the innocent&mdash;Joanna
the Mad, Katharine of Aragon, and Margaret of
Austria&mdash;who had to suffer the unhappiness caused
by the ambition and unscrupulousness of others. Of
the three, Margaret was by far the most fortunate,
because she was stronger-minded and abler than her
sisters-in-law, and, after her early inexperienced youth,
she was worldly wise enough to look after her own
interests. But even her life was full of pathos and
sacrifice, nobly and cheerfully borne, and of heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVI" id="Page_XVI">XVI</a></span>
responsibility assumed serenely for the sake of the
nephew whom she reared so worthily and served so well.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tremayne in the pages of this book has dwelt
fully upon the busy later years of Margaret's life,
drawing her information from many sources, in some
cases not previously utilised, and there is little more
to be told of these years than is here set forth. But
it happens that since this book was in print a series
of hitherto unknown documents of the highest interest
have been printed for the first time in Spanish
by the Duke of Berwick and Alba, which throw
many sidelights upon Margaret's early widowhood,
and upon her share in the intrigues by which her
brother, Philip, endeavoured to deprive his father-in-law,
Ferdinand, of the regency of Castile, after the
death of Isabella the Catholic. It is fair to say that,
although on one or two occasions Ferdinand's agents
complained that Margaret favoured her brother as
against his unhappy, distraught wife, which, if true,
was quite natural, she generally appears throughout
the documents in question as a kindly, gentle mediatress,
endeavouring to reconcile the bitter feud that
ended so tragically, and to safeguard the children
whom she loved and cared for tenderly when their
father's death and their mother's madness left them
doubly orphaned.</p>

<p>The Fuensalida correspondence, to which reference
has been made, opens at the end of 1495, when the
treaty for alliance and the double marriages of Philip
and Joanna, and John and Margaret, had just been
signed, and the instructions given by Ferdinand to
the new ambassador, Fuensalida, whom he sent to
Germany to keep Maximilian up to the mark, even
thus early show the profound distrust which underlay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVII" id="Page_XVII">XVII</a></span>
the ostensibly cordial alliance upon which double
marriages were to set the seal. 'What you have to
do,' run the instructions, 'is to take care to maintain
the King of the Romans in his good will to carry
through these marriages ... and to strive to get
him to give in the Milanese such aid and support as
may be needed, declaring war against the King of
France, as we have done for his sake.'</p>

<p>Ferdinand knew that the surest pledge he could
have of Maximilian's effective co-operation would be
the presence of Margaret in Spain, especially if he
could manage to get her into his possession before his
own daughter Joanna was sent to Flanders. 'If it
be managed without inconvenience we should like
Madame Margaret to come hither as soon as the
betrothal is effected, before the Infanta our daughter
goes; immediately if the weather will permit....
It may be done as follows. If at the time of the
formal betrothal there are any ships there belonging
to our subjects, sufficient to bring the Archduchess
safely, the weather being fair, Rojas (<i>i.e.</i> Ferdinand's
envoy in Flanders) may take all such vessels at such
freight as he can, to be paid on their arrival here in
Spain, and bring her in the fleet with God's grace.
Her coming thus would be safer, for she would
arrive before the affair was publicly known, and if
it can be done you will not delay for the Archduchess's
trousseau, ornaments, and household baggage,
which can be sent afterwards.' But, continues
the King of Aragon, if it cannot be done, Joanna shall
be sent in a Spanish fleet, and Margaret can embark
in it on its return to Spain. The careful Ferdinand
remarks in his instructions that he intended to send
with his daughter only eight ladies and the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVIII" id="Page_XVIII">XVIII</a></span>
attendants strictly necessary, and although Maximilian
was not to be told this in as many words, he was to
be persuaded to limit his daughter's household to
accompany her to Spain to the smallest possible proportions.</p>

<p>But Maximilian, who was as wary as Ferdinand,
had no notion of allowing his daughter to be sent to
Spain before the Spanish Infanta arrived in Flanders,
and it was early in March of the year 1497 before
Margaret first set her foot on Spanish soil at Santander.
Seven months afterwards fate dealt its first
crushing blow upon Ferdinand's plans, and the bride,
not yet eighteen, found herself a widow. She had
become greatly beloved in Spain, and Ferdinand and
Isabel, especially the latter, in the midst of their
own grief, cherished the daughter-in-law who might
yet, they hoped, give them an heir to the crowns
of Spain. Ferdinand, in conveying (in December
1497) the news of his son's death to his ambassador
for the information of Maximilian, wrote: 'Tell
him that our distress has prevented us from
sending him the news earlier, and that our grief is
increased by considerations for Princess Margaret,
although she tries very hard, as befits her, to bear
her trouble gently and wisely; and we try our best
to console and please her, endeavouring to make her
forget her loss. Her pregnancy, thanks be to God,
goes on well, and we hope in His mercy that the
result will be a reparation and consolation for our
trouble. We do, and will, take as much care of the
Princess as we would of her husband if he were alive,
and she will always fill the same place as he did in
our hearts.'</p>

<p>When this hope had fled, and Ferdinand and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIX" id="Page_XIX">XIX</a></span>
Isabella proclaimed their eldest daughter, the Queen
of Portugal, as their heir, Maximilian took the matter
very philosophically, as well he might, for it brought
much nearer the probability which Ferdinand had, as
he thought, so cleverly guarded against, that the House
of Hapsburg might rule over the greatest empire that
had existed since the days of Alexander, and poor
little Aragon be swamped by its sovereign's larger
interests. Margaret had written to tell her father
the dolorous news of her child's still-birth, and
Maximilian contented himself with sending a message
by his secretary to the Spanish ambassador, saying
that although such an event naturally caused him
some sorrow, he, bearing in mind that it was sent by
God, for some good purpose of His own, accepted it
without complaint, and thanked the Almighty for all
things. Bearing in mind, moreover, that since Prince
John himself had died, nothing that happened could
increase his grief, for his heart had no room for more
sorrow, he had decided to make no demonstration
of mourning for the present calamity, and not to
suffer any to be made by others.</p>

<p>Margaret appears to have been really grateful to
Isabella the Catholic for her goodness to her in her
trouble, for she wrote to her father in February 1498,
that the Queen had never left her, and had been so
kind that, considering the danger she, Margaret, had
been in, she would have died but for solicitude of
Isabella. When Maximilian told this to Fuensalida,
the ambassador, of course by Ferdinand's orders,
said it was painful to speak yet of Margaret's remarriage,
but as she was young it was but natural
that she would marry again. 'There is no prince in
Christendom whom she could marry,' replied Maximilian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XX" id="Page_XX">XX</a></span>
'The King of Naples has no son of marriageable
age; the King of England has already
betrothed his son to the daughter of the Catholic
sovereigns; the King of Scotland is a poor thing;
the Duke of York (<i>i.e.</i> Perkin Warbeck) is married,
and not at liberty; the King of Hungary has a wife
already; the King of Poland is a nobody; so that
there is no fit husband for her. It is true that the
King of France is talking of repudiating his wife
(<i>i.e.</i> Anne of Brittany), and marrying her to Monsieur
Louis with great dowries and states, whilst he keeps
Brittany, since he has lost hope of having children by
her, and he wants to marry my daughter Margaret.
But I will not consent to this on any account, nor
would my daughter, for she has a great objection to
go to France. Besides, I know for a fact that the
King of France caused something to be given to her
to bring on her miscarriage, and tried to poison King
Ferdinand as well; so that there is nothing to be
said about my daughter's marriage yet awhile.'</p>

<p>We may be quite sure that this hint that a French
alliance was possible for Margaret was intended to
remind Ferdinand that he must be careful not to
offend his ally, and the ambassador urged very
earnestly in the name of his master that Margaret
might be allowed to stay in Spain until her remarriage
was arranged: 'because whilst she was with
the King and Queen the King of France would be
unable to work his will with her, as he would have
no opportunity of dealing in the matter, he being on
bad terms with the King and Queen; besides which
they would, in any case, refuse to listen to anything
so shameful. But if, on the other hand, the Princess
(Margaret) were in any of these States (<i>i.e.</i> Germany),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXI" id="Page_XXI">XXI</a></span>
the King of France might be able to push the matter
more warmly. Besides,' continued the ambassador,
'surely it would be best to avoid the risk of bringing
the Princess home by sea, and the heavy expense
that you (<i>i.e.</i> Maximilian) would have to incur in
fitting out a fleet for the purpose.' To all this, and
much more to the same effect, Maximilian replied
but doubtfully. He knew full well that whilst Ferdinand
held so valuable a pledge as Margaret in his
hands he could always extort from his ally, her
father, whatever he thought fit, and Maximilian,
with the matrimonial value of his daughter in view,
especially as the Spaniards knew that he was already
in full negotiation for peace with France over
Ferdinand's head, could only repeat that he must
have his daughter back soon, though for the moment
the question was dropped.</p>

<p>When some months afterwards, in August 1498,
Maximilian had made a separate peace with France,
much to Ferdinand's indignation, he determined to
bring Margaret home at any cost. Why, asked
Fuensalida of Maximilian, was he sending so important
and unexpected an embassy to Spain? 'I
am sending for my daughter,' replied the King of the
Romans. 'If your Majesty means to bring her home
at once,' exclaimed the ambassador, 'you ought to
have sent notice to my King and Queen, and not
bring away so great a princess as she is thus suddenly.
In any case she could not come until December.' 'I
cannot wait so long as that,' replied Maximilian.
'But,' objected the ambassador, 'she cannot come
before. It will take until September for your
ambassadors to reach Spain, and all October will be
spent in getting ships ready, and then another month
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXII" id="Page_XXII">XXII</a></span>
for the Princess to join them, and perhaps even two
months; and then the season of the year will be unfit
for any one to go to sea, and the King and Queen will
not like to expose the Princess to such danger.
Besides,' continued he, always ready to appeal to
Maximilian's parsimony, 'if your Majesty had given
due notice to my King and Queen you might have
saved a great deal of money, for they would have
fitted out a fleet in which the Princess might have
come with all honour and safety; and even now, if
your Majesty will wait until March, I will do my
best to arrange it in this way, and you will not have
to spend half so much money.'</p>

<p>But Maximilian knew the value of his daughter in
his hands, and replied roughly that he would not wait.
He would have her safe home, he said, before he
began war again. 'If I send a single carrack from
Genoa, and the King and Queen give her a convoy of
four barks, she will come safe enough.' In vain the
ambassador urged that corsairs and Frenchmen could
not be trusted, and that it was a slight for such a
princess to be sent home in so unceremonious a
fashion. Maximilian was obstinate; he would have
his daughter Margaret home at once, no matter at
what risk. To add to his eagerness news came from
Margaret herself, brought by special messengers of
her household, who had much to say of the changed
demeanour of the Spaniards, now that Maximilian
had made a separate peace. Fuensalida did his best
by underhand means, frightening the German ambassadors
of the sea-voyage from Genoa to Spain and
back in the winter, and of the dreadful corsairs who
infested the Mediterranean, until they at last, really
alarmed, begged Maximilian in Fuensalida's presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXIII" id="Page_XXIII">XXIII</a></span>
to let them have a very big carrack for their greater
safety. Better send them by way of Flanders, interposed
the artful Fuensalida, knowing the long delay
which such a voyage would entail; but Maximilian
angrily told him that he would do nothing of the
sort.</p>

<p>So effectually had the Spaniard frightened the
landsmen ambassadors of the sea that they themselves
threw every possible obstacle in their master's
way, and told Fuensalida that, even though King
Maximilian ordered them to go and fetch the Princess
Margaret before Christmas, they would not do so.
Come what might, they said, they would not put to
sea before Easter. They were not allowed, however,
to delay quite so long as that, for Maximilian was
determined to have his daughter out of the hands of
Ferdinand, who he feared was making terms for
himself by offering her in marriage to the new King
of France, Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> In writing to Margaret in
September, her father, referring to his and her own
desire that she should return to Flanders or Germany,
says that 'no importunity nor pressure of any sort
will move him from his resolve to bring her back at
once,' and he urges her to insist upon her departure
without loss of time.</p>

<p>Fortunately now, especially for the timid German
ambassadors, the road overland through France
was open, and Margaret travelled in comfort and
safety to her home in Flanders early in 1499, to
see Spain no more. Thither, too, went soon afterwards
the Spanish ambassador Fuensalida, accredited
especially to the Archduke Philip and his Spanish
wife Joanna, whose conduct was already profoundly
grieving Ferdinand and Isabella; and from Flanders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXIV" id="Page_XXIV">XXIV</a></span>
the ambassador was to proceed to England and
pin Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> down irrevocably to the marriage
of his son Arthur with Katharine. Already Ferdinand
more than suspected that Maximilian was
playing him false, and forming a league against him
by negotiating Margaret's marriage with Arthur,
Prince of Wales, already betrothed more than once
to the Spanish princess. Fuensalida's mission was a
delicate one; for Margaret's Flemish household had
come back from Spain full of complaints, and the
Court of Flanders was sharply divided by the partisans
of Spain and Burgundy respectively, of the Archduchess
Joanna and her dissolute husband, Philip.
Margaret was to be conciliated as much as possible,
and kept in the Spanish interest. 'You will visit
our daughter the Princess Margaret,' wrote Ferdinand
and Isabella to their envoy, 'and say that we
beseech her to let us know how she is after her long
journey; for we desire her health and welfare as that
of our own daughter. For the love we bear her we
will do everything in our power most willingly to aid
and forward her settlement.' The envoy was also
urged to counteract the efforts of those who wished
to make bad blood between Flanders and Spain, and
especially to enlist Margaret in favour of poor Joanna,
her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Fuensalida followed hard on the heels of Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>
from St. Omer and Calais to London, endeavouring by
every means to discover how much truth there was
in the assertion that an arrangement had been concluded
to throw over Katharine of Aragon and marry
the Prince of Wales to Margaret as a result of the
mysterious foregathering of the King of England
with the Archduke Philip. The story of Fuensalida's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXV" id="Page_XXV">XXV</a></span>
successful though turbulent mission to England is
told elsewhere;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but on his return to Flanders he
found Margaret in the deepest anxiety with regard
to her own affairs. Neither she nor Maximilian
desired to forward by her marriage in England the
anti-Spanish combination of England, France, and
Flanders which Philip was planning; her dowry from
Spain was, as was natural with Ferdinand for a pay-master,
in arrear; and the coming voyage to Spain of
Philip and Joanna at the urgent summons of Ferdinand
and Isabella, who hoped to win over the Archduke,
if possible, from his alliance with their enemies,
was a subject of the deepest concern to Margaret.</p>

<p>When Fuensalida first saw Margaret on his return
to Brussels from England, in August 1500, she
welcomed him eagerly in the belief that he brought
some special message to her from Spain. He told
her that his mission was simply one of affection
towards her, and she made no attempt to hide her
disappointment. The cause of her anxiety was soon
apparent. Fuensalida reported in the same letter
that the bastard of Savoy had been to see her secretly,
and that she and her father, Maximilian, had looked
with favour upon the proposal of the Duke of Savoy
to marry her. Such a marriage was, of course, a
blow, as it was intended to be, against her brother
Philip's anti-Spanish projects, because not only did
it leave Katharine of Aragon's marriage with the
Prince of Wales undisturbed, but it secured Savoy to
the imperial and Aragonese interests against France,
which was of the highest importance as touching the
French designs upon Italy. Her marriage in Savoy,
moreover, was opposed strongly by Philip for another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXVI" id="Page_XXVI">XXVI</a></span>
reason, namely, that he would, in case it was effected,
be obliged to hand to his sister the domains belonging
to Burgundy which had been bequeathed to her by
her mother; and in order to frustrate it Philip brought
forward the recently widowed King of Portugal as a
fit husband for Margaret, which would have secured
her residence in a distant country, and his continued
occupation of her Burgundian inheritance.</p>

<p>Successive deaths had now made Philip and Joanna
heirs of Spain, as well as of Burgundy, Flanders,
and the Empire; the Archduke was already betrothing
his infant son, Charles, the future King of Castile,
to a French princess, and his open negotiations for
the formation of a league against Ferdinand to assert
Joanna's right to assume the crown of Castile on the
death of her mother Isabella, who was in failing
health, had fairly frightened Ferdinand, who knew
not whom to trust; for Castilians generally disliked
him, and were ready to acclaim Joanna and her foreign
husband on the first opportunity&mdash;Joanna herself was
unstable, violently jealous of her husband, and with
strange notions as regarded religion. She would
not go to Spain alone, and Philip was determined
not to go except on his own terms, and at his
own time, and Margaret, living in close contact with
the inharmonious pair, struggled bravely to reconcile
the clashing interests that surrounded her.</p>

<p>There was a talk of leaving her regent of Flanders
in the absence of her brother in Spain, and against
this Ferdinand's agents were instructed to work
secretly; although Margaret lost no opportunity of
professing to the ambassador her attachment to
Spanish interests. From several remarks in Fuensalida's
letters to Ferdinand it is, however, evident that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXVII" id="Page_XXVII">XXVII</a></span>
her desire was less to rule Flanders than to enjoy the
care of the infants whom her brother and sister-in-law
were to leave behind. But even this natural
desire was opposed by the Spaniards; apparently
because the Princess was looked upon as being too
ready to follow her brother's lead. Writing in March
1501 of Philip's dissolute life and his disaffection
towards Spain, Fuensalida says: 'I am loath to say
how much Madam Margaret's good-nature encourages
this, for she simply follows her brother's fancies
in all things.'</p>

<p>But the departure of Margaret from Flanders in
August 1501 for her marriage with the Duke of
Savoy put an end for a time to her pretensions to
take charge of her brother's children; and when she
returned as a young widow early in 1505, the issue
between Ferdinand and his undutiful son-in-law
was joined, for Isabella the Catholic was dead, and
Philip in right of his wife was arrogantly claiming,
not only the crown of Castile, but the entire control
of its policy against the wish of the great Queen just
dead, whose last hours were embittered by the dread
that her beloved, her sacred, Castile, would be ruled
by a foreigner of doubtful orthodoxy. Philip was
abetted in his revolt against Ferdinand by the
Castilian officers attached to him who were jealous
of Aragon, Don Juan Manuel, the principal Spanish
diplomatist of his time, being their leader and Philip's
prime adviser. As soon as Margaret arrived in her
brother's Court both factions tried to gain her. 'My
lady,' Don Juan Manuel is represented to have said
to her on one occasion (June 1505), 'I shall be able
to serve you quite as effectively as Antonio de
Fonseca when I am in Castile and Treasurer-General';
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXVIII" id="Page_XXVIII">XXVIII</a></span>
and at this time, when Philip and his friends were
anticipating the rich booty they would gain in Castile,
whither they were bound to take possession of mad
Joanna's inheritance, Margaret was beset with offers
of reward if she would throw in her influence against
King Ferdinand.</p>

<p>It is abundantly clear that she grieved at the
unhappy state of affairs. Ferdinand and his wife had
been good to her in Spain, and easy-going as she may
have been, she must have seen her brother's unworthiness
and his bad treatment of Joanna; and yet it was
neither prudent nor natural that she should oppose
Philip violently. Fuensalida saw her in Bois le Duc
in June 1505, whilst she was on her way to Bourg,
and discussed matters with her. 'She told me that
she had talked to her brother, and had asked him
whether he would allow her to mediate between him
and your Highness (Ferdinand), and he had answered,
"No, you are still marriageable, and so is he, and I
will not have any such third person interposing between
us." She told me that her father and brother
have made her swear that she will not entertain any
marriage without their consent. She really believes
that those who are around her brother have turned
his head, and will not let him make terms with your
Highness.... She bids me tell your Highness
that she will continue to be as obedient a daughter to
you as she was when she was with you in Spain; and
that she is going to her own home now for no other
reason than that she cannot bear to see in silence the
things that are going on, whereas if she spoke of
them or protested against them, evil would come of
it. She prefers, therefore, to go away, so that she
may not witness them personally; for she sees quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXIX" id="Page_XXIX">XXIX</a></span>
plainly that the destruction of her brother's and her
father's house will ensue. She prays your Highness
to make use of her services in any way you please,
and she will do for you all that a good daughter may.
"Why not speak to Queen Joanna?" I said. "Because
they will not let me," she answered. I am told that
Don Juan Manuel said to her (Margaret), what is the
use of your going to speak to a stone? You might
just as well speak to a stone as to the Queen.'</p>

<p>Margaret herself was determined not to be drawn
into the shameful intrigue by which her brother
sought to supplant his wife and her father in order to
rule Castile himself and for his own pleasure; but it
is evident that no stone was left unturned to gain
her, directly or indirectly, by Don Juan Manuel and
his friends. One of Margaret's officers was a certain
Monsieur Louis, to whom Manuel offered, 'that if
he would prevail upon his mistress to follow in all
things the wishes of King Philip, her brother, he
would get the King to give to Louis from the
revenues of Castile an income equal to the highest
officer of his household. Louis, he said, knew
Castile: let him look about and choose any office or
place he liked, and it should be granted to him.
Louis succumbed to this temptation; but the Duchess
(Margaret) heard of it, and never consented to speak
to him again, although he had been her most trusted
servant.'</p>

<p>Through this wretched business, which ended in
the triumph of Ferdinand by the untimely death, probably
by poison, of Philip in Spain, and the lifelong
incarceration of crazy Joanna, Margaret is the only
person who stands forth pure and unselfish. In the
summer of 1505, when Philip and Joanna were about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXX" id="Page_XXX">XXX</a></span>
to start on their voyage to Spain, Margaret set out
for her own castle of Pont d'Ain, full of her projects
for building Brou; but just as she reached the
frontier of her brother's dominions she was stopped by
the news that her little nephew, Charles, was suffering
from fever, and she determined to retrace her steps
to see the children again, and bid farewell once more
to unhappy Joanna.</p>

<p>From her quiet retreat in Bresse Margaret was
summoned, on the death of her brother, to rule
the States, and care for the children whom he had
left behind, bereft of a mother's care by the lunacy
of Joanna. How nobly and self-sacrificingly she fulfilled
her trust this book to some extent will tell; but
of all the sacrifices she made in her wise and gentle
life none was greater than the renunciation of her
love, perhaps the only love she ever experienced, for
the handsome Englishman who appears to have
treated her so shabbily. For Charles Brandon,
though his King's first favourite and brother-in-law,
hardly played the game of love very fairly with
Margaret. Kneeling at her feet in sweet dalliance
after the banquet at Tournai, he drew from her
finger, as lovers will, a ring, and placed it upon his
own hand. In gentle chiding she told him in French,
and then in Flemish so like English that he understood,
that he was a thief. But soon she became
alarmed when she saw he meant to keep it for a
pledge; for it was well known and might compromise
her; and she prayed him to restore it. 'But he
understood me not,' and only the intervention of
Henry the King, and a promise of a bracelet of hers
in exchange, made Charles Brandon give up his
capture. But not for long; for again on his knees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXXI" id="Page_XXXI">XXXI</a></span>
before the Princess at Lille soon afterwards, he took
the ring a second time, and all the entreaties of the
lady were unavailing to obtain its restoration, though
a ring of far greater value was given to her in
exchange, with all sorts of imprudent, perhaps not
more than half-serious, promises on both sides never
to marry without the consent of the other. Margaret,
as she pathetically says, had never any intention of
marrying at all, so unhappy had she been in her
previous marriages: but at all events she hid Brandon's
ring in her bosom, unseen by the world, and
cherished the secret of her little love passage. Not
so King Henry's flamboyant favourite, who made no
concealment of his conquest, and vaunted the possession
of the jewel, though faithful Margaret could not
believe it of him: 'for I esteem him much a man of
virtue and wise.'</p>

<p>The sad little romance presents Margaret as a
dignified great lady, who for one short space allowed
herself to be simply a trustful woman in love, only to
find that to such as she duty must be paramount over
the promptings of the heart, and that a wooer, though
he may be a duke, is not always a gentleman.
Thenceforward, for many years, Margaret's life was
that of a wise Vice-Regent for the Emperor whom
she had reared from his childhood; until death relieved
her from the task to which she devoted the best of
her life. She died in harness, defrauded of an old age
of refined leisure, to which she had looked forward,
deprived even of a sight of the splendid church which
is her own worthy tomb and monument; but it was
perhaps most fitting that she should fall in the plenitude
of her powers, leaving her beloved nephew the
undisputed sovereign of the greatest dominion in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXXII" id="Page_XXXII">XXXII</a></span>
world, at peace with all Christendom, thanks largely
to her efforts; and that she should go down to
posterity remembered mainly as the first and noblest
of the women of her imperial race who bore the title
of Governess of the Netherlands.</p>

<h2>THE FIRST GOVERNESS OF<br />
THE NETHERLANDS<br />
MARGARET OF AUSTRIA</h2>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>QUEEN OF FRANCE</h3>

<p class="p2">In the year 1491 an interview took place in the
little town of Baugy in Poitou, between a
youth of twenty-one and a girl of twelve. The
fate of more than one kingdom was involved in this
farewell meeting between two playfellows who had
been companions and friends for nearly nine years.
The youth had tears in his eyes as he hesitatingly
made his excuses and unfolded his plan. He told
his fair-haired companion that though he loved her
with all his heart, yet he had made up his mind to
send her back to her father, who had often expressed
the wish to have her with him. The little maiden
listened to her youthful husband's repudiation of
his marriage vows with calm dignity, but when he
continued to make excuses for his conduct she stopped
him, saying with much spirit, 'that by reason of her
youth, those who had counted on her fortune could
never say or suspect that this had come upon her
through any fault of her own.' The slight thus inflicted,
the girl never forgot; and when years later she
became Governess of the Netherlands, France knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
no greater enemy than Margaret of Austria, former
Queen of France.</p>

<p>Margaret was born at Brussels<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> on January 10th,
1480, and baptized in Saint Gudule. Her godparents
were Philippe de Ravenstein, Jean de Châlons, Prince
of Orange, and Margaret of York, sister of Edward <span class="smcap">IV.</span>,
King of England, third wife of Charles the Bold.</p>

<p>Margaret was the only daughter of the Archduke
Maximilian, afterwards King of the Romans, and
Emperor of Germany, by Mary of Burgundy, only
daughter and heiress of Charles, Duke of Burgundy,
surnamed the Bold.</p>

<p>When Margaret was barely two years old her
mother died from the effects of a fall from a horse at
the age of twenty-five, leaving two children, Philip
(born 22nd July 1478) and Margaret. The Flemish
States, discontented with Maximilian's rule, claimed
their ancient right to educate his children, but in
accordance with the terms of a treaty of peace signed
at Arras between Louis <span class="smcap">XI.</span> and the Archduke in the
year 1483, Margaret was betrothed to the Dauphin
Charles, afterwards Charles <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, and was sent to
France to be brought up and educated with the
French princes. On the 2nd of June 1483, at the
age of three, she made her entry into Paris amidst
transports of joy, at the conclusion of the peace of
which her presence was the pledge. 'And in honour
of my said lady Margaret, who from henceforth was
called Dauphine, the streets were decorated, and
many people rejoiced.'<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Louis <span class="smcap">XI.</span> did not appear at
these fêtes; he contented himself with secretly rejoicing
over the successful issue of his cunning policy,
an issue which would mean, as he foresaw, the downfall
of the powerful house of Burgundy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Margaret's dowry was a large one, consisting of
Burgundy, the county of Artois, and the territories
of Macon, Salins, Bar-sur-Seine, and Noyers. The
ceremony of betrothal took place at Amboise with
great pomp in presence of a numerous gathering
assembled in the public square.</p>

<p>Charles, aged twelve, declared that he consented
to take the three-year-old Margaret as his wife.
The religious ceremony was performed the same day
in the lower church of the castle, in presence of the
lords and ladies of Beaujeu, of the Sire de la
Trémouille, the Counts of Dunois, d'Albret, and
many deputies from the provincial towns. The
Dauphin, clothed in a robe of white damask lined
with black velvet, married the little princess, and
placed a ring upon her tiny finger. A mass was
said, and a sermon preached by the Abbé of Saint
Bertain, who compared this marriage to that of King
Ahasuerus and Queen Esther; after which the
Dauphin thanked all those who were present.</p>

<p>Two months later Louis <span class="smcap">XI.</span> died (30th August
1483), leaving his kingdom to his son Charles, and
appointing his favourite daughter, Anne de Beaujeu,
as Regent. From the time of Louis' death Margaret
was treated as queen, and given the honours due to
her rank. Her childhood passed peacefully at
Amboise, where she became the pet and plaything
of her youthful husband, and of his cousin Louis,
Duke of Orleans. It would be interesting to know
the story of Margaret's life during the nine or ten
years she was under the guardianship of Anne de
Beaujeu. Charles's mother, the poor Queen Charlotte
of Savoy, died soon after her eldest son's marriage,
leaving the education of the young couple to the
Regent Anne, whose vigorous intellect was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
satisfied with ruling the kingdom of France for her
brother. She read a great deal, early fathers, philosophers,
moralists and poets, and selected romances
for the young people under her charge. Her library
contained three hundred and fourteen volumes, some
of which are noted in the catalogue as being covered
with red velvet, and ornamented with clasps, bosses,
and corner pieces of metal.</p>

<p>If it is true that the first years of life, early
education and precepts, influence the rest of existence,
then Margaret must have had a very careful bringing
up at the French Court, to judge from the marked
talents, wisdom, and prudence she displayed in later
years. Amongst her companions at the castle of
Amboise we find Louise of Savoy, her senior by three
years. Louise (the mother of Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>) was the
daughter of the Sieur de Bresse and Margaret of
Bourbon, and sister of Philibert <span class="smcap">II.</span>, Duke of Savoy,
Margaret's future husband. Louise was a niece of
Anne de Beaujeu's, and appears to have been treated
as a poor relation, 'only receiving eighty francs at
the New Year with which to buy herself a crimson
satin dress for state occasions.' Anne's sickly little
daughter, Susan, must also have been one of Margaret's
younger playfellows.</p>

<p>The Lady of Beaujeu was devoted to hunting, and
she hunted, we are told, 'coldly and methodically,
with her own eyes examining the trail, and giving
the word to hark forward, setting off with her
hounds, and skilfully handling her hunting-spear.
She probably encouraged this sport amongst her
young companions, for we learn in after years that
Margaret was a great huntress, and very proud of
her stuffed wolves' heads.' Unhappily, no detailed
account exists of Margaret's childhood in France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
but from what we know of her life at Amboise she
seems to have been a bright and lively child, with a
marvellously fair complexion, golden hair and soft
brown eyes, making many friends, with a gift for
repartee and a strong sense of humour, which probably
helped her to bear the many sorrows of her later life.</p>

<p>Years after, when Louis of Orleans was King of
France, he refers in his letters to Margaret to their
happy youth at Amboise when 'she was the second
person he loved best in the world; that he desires
above all things to embrace his cousin, his vassal, his
first mistress, to remind her of their childish games,
and after having made her blush by his compliments,
to swear eternal love for her.'</p>

<p>In 1488 Francis <span class="smcap">II.</span>, Duke of Brittany, died, leaving
only two daughters, Anne and Isabel. The latter did
not long survive her father, but dying in August 1491
at the age of twelve, left her sister Anne sole possessor
of the important duchy of Brittany. As early as
1480 Duke Francis had tried to arrange a marriage
between his daughter Anne, or failing her, her younger
sister Isabel, and the eldest son of Edward <span class="smcap">IV.</span>,
King of England, but these plans were frustrated by
the young prince's murder in the Tower of London.</p>

<p>Negotiations were then begun for an alliance with
Maximilian, Duke of Austria, but were postponed
owing to the princess's extreme youth. Amongst
foreign alliances this seemed the most advantageous,
although it offered no guarantee for the independence
and maintenance of Brittany's nationality. The best
way to ensure this independence would have been to
marry Anne to one of the nobles of her own country
chosen from amongst those who had pretensions to
the ducal crown. These were three in number:
John of Châlons, Prince of Orange, a son of one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Duke Francis <span class="smcap">II.</span>'s sisters; John, Viscount de Rohan,
who had married Mary, daughter of Duke Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>,
who claimed to be the direct descendant of Conan
Mériadec, first King of Brittany; and Alain d'Albret,
husband of a great-granddaughter of Joan the Lame.
When Francis <span class="smcap">II.</span> died, only the last of these three
was a widower, and he was an unsuitable husband
for a princess of thirteen, being more than forty-five
years of age, and the father of eight children.</p>

<p>The Lords of her Council advised the young
duchess to marry Maximilian of Austria, King of the
Romans, and Anne, who was just entering her
fourteenth year, agreed to this union. The preliminary
negotiations for the marriage were arranged
with the greatest secrecy in March 1490. Maximilian
sent the Count of Nassau, Marshal Polhain, Jacques
de Codebault, his secretary, and his steward, Louppian,
to Brittany to negotiate matters, and arrange the
betrothal. A few days after, so secretly that the
day is not known, this ceremony took place according
to German custom. In order to make the marriage
indissoluble, says Legendre, and to give it the
appearance of a consummated marriage, the Count of
Nassau (others say it was the handsome Polhain,
Maximilian's favourite), who had married Anne in
his master's name, put his leg bared to the knee into
the bride's bed in presence of the lords and ladies
who were nominated as witnesses. When the details
of this ceremony were divulged they caused great
derision amongst the Bretons and French, who
ridiculed a custom so different from their own. This
marriage was a flagrant violation of the last treaty
with France, for Charles <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, whose ward the young
duchess was, had not been consulted. As soon as
he received information of the fact, he sent his troops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
into Brittany, and penetrated farther and farther
into that country, and Nantes was taken almost
without a struggle by Alain d'Albret. In the first
days of the year 1491 Charles <span class="smcap">VIII</span>., accompanied by
the Count of Dunois, Louis, Duke of Orleans, and
the Lady of Beaujeu, joined his army in Brittany.
The king held his Court at Nantes, and did his
utmost to insinuate himself into the good graces
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Anne, at the head of a small army under her tutor,
the Marshal de Rieux, vainly tried to struggle against
the French invaders. After many skirmishes, de
Rieux obliged the French to retire to lower Brittany,
until he received reinforcements from England. Anne
showed a courage beyond her years and worthy of
better success. She took refuge at last in the town
of Rennes with her uncle the Prince of Orange,
Marshal Polhain, and several faithful nobles, having
only 14,000 men to defend her, principally English
archers, Germans, and Spaniards, sent by her husband,
the King of the Romans.</p>

<p>In 1491 the French laid siege to the town. Charles
gradually drew his lines closer and closer; lack of
food and money began to be felt in the beleaguered
city. Charles offered the duchess 100,000 crowns
a year if she would renounce the Government of
Brittany, and choose any dwelling-place she pleased
except the towns of Rennes and Nantes; he also
suggested the choice of three husbands, either Louis
of Luxembourg, the Duke of Nemours, or the Count
of Angoulême.</p>

<p>Anne replied that she was married to the King of
the Romans, and that if he refused to have her, she
still would consider herself his wife, and would never
be the wife of another. Should Maximilian die, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
she be in a position to remarry, she would only marry
a king or the son of a king.</p>

<p>Charles, convinced of her obstinacy, then tried to
induce her garrison to desert. Being chiefly mercenary
troops they succumbed to persistent bribery,
and marched out of the town, leaving it free for him
to enter. After taking possession he made a new
proposition to the duchess, namely, to renounce for
ever all rights to the duchy of Brittany excepting
an allowance of £100,000 a year, and retire to the
King of the Romans, whom she looked upon as her
husband.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the siege of Rennes, Anne's
youngest sister, Isabel, died in the town on the 24th
August 1491. By her death in her twelfth year
Anne was left sole heiress of the largest duchy
in Europe. This was too attractive a bait for
Charles's ambition, and he made up his mind to break
his marriage with his old playfellow Margaret, and
to do all in his power to make Anne accept him as
her husband.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that the young Duchess of
Brittany or rather her advisers were in no hurry to
reply to Charles's last monstrous proposition. After
waiting some time he again tried a new plan, and,
partly by threats and partly by promises, persuaded
her advisers to work on their young mistress's mind
in such a way as to bring her to think more kindly
of him. Her uncle, Prince of Orange, Marshal de
Rieux, Montauban, Chancellor of Brittany, and her
governess, Frances of Dinan, talked so much on the
subject, that by degrees they got her slightly to
change her mind. It was no wonder that Anne felt
a great repugnance for Charles, who for three years
had carried on war against her, ruining her lands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
and under pretext of being her lawful protector
trying to take her prisoner. For several days her
councillors, won over by Charles, endeavoured to
bring her to reason, without success; but at last her
governess had recourse to her confessor, who persuaded
her that God and the Church ordained that
she should make this sacrifice for the sake of peace
and the good of her country.</p>

<p>Charles, under pretence of a pilgrimage, went with
all his Court to the chapel of Our Lady situated near
the gates of Rennes. After performing his religious
duties he suddenly entered the town, accompanied by
his sister, Anne de Beaujeu, Count Dunois, and a
hundred men-at-arms and fifty archers of the guard.
The next day he paid a visit to the young duchess,
and had a long interview with her. Three days later
their betrothal was celebrated in the chapel of Our
Lady in presence of the Duke of Orleans, Count
Dunois, and Anne de Beaujeu on one side; the
Chancellor of Brittany, the Prince of Orange, and
several nobles devoted to the duchess on the
other.</p>

<p>Marshal Wolfgang de Polhain, instructed by
Maximilian to betroth Anne to his master, heard
a rumour of this hasty alliance. He questioned the
French and Breton nobles, but they refused to
give him an answer. A few days later he was invited
to the marriage ceremony which had been
arranged to take place in the castle of Langeais in
Touraine. Polhain refused to attend, and hastened
to Malines to give Maximilian an account of these
proceedings.</p>

<p>This sudden marriage caused great astonishment
throughout Europe. How could people believe that
the young duchess, then in her fourteenth year, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
well able to understand the importance of her acts,
had consented to marry a king who for years had
made war against her and despoiled her of her
heritage! Besides it was well known that since the
Treaty of Arras in 1483 Charles had been affianced
to Maximilian's daughter, Margaret of Austria.</p>

<p>The rumour got about that the Duchess Anne had
been forced into the marriage. The Pope believed
this, and in granting the dispensation which was only
asked for after the marriage had taken place, he
formally announced that he would only confirm this
union if it could be proved that it had not been
brought about by force. Anne herself undertook to
refute this calumny by declaring before an ecclesiastical
commission that she had suffered no violence, and
that she had gone to Langeais of her own free will
to marry Charles.</p>

<p>In the marriage contract a clause was inserted to
the effect that should Anne survive Charles, without
children, she could only remarry with his successor.
Thus was the duchy of Brittany secured to the
crown of France, and the king's ambitious scheme
realised to Margaret's mortification.</p>

<p>Mézerai tells us that 'a double dispensation was
necessary, first to annul Charles's marriage with
Margaret, and secondly to free Anne from her contract
with Maximilian. The marriages not having
been consummated, the Court of Rome did not make
any great difficulty.'</p>

<p>When Maximilian heard that his affianced bride
had become the wife of Charles <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, and that his
daughter was about to be returned to him despoiled
of her title of Queen of France, he made all the
Courts of Europe ring with his complaints. War
began again and lasted for two years. In 1493 peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
was restored by the Treaty of Senlis, concluded
between Charles and Maximilian. The King of the
Romans renounced the title of Duke of Brittany,
and was put in possession of the whole duchy
of Burgundy as well as the Franche Comté, and
Artois, which had been included in Margaret's
dowry.</p>

<p>If we are to believe Pasquier, Margaret had a
foreboding of her misfortune before these events took
place. One day whilst walking in the garden at
Amboise, her ladies and gentlemen noticed that she
seemed very melancholy, and one of them asked her
the reason. She replied that she had had a strange
dream, which she could not forget, for she believed
it boded ill. In her dream she thought she was in
a large park, and saw a marguerite (daisy) which she
was told to watch; whilst she gazed at the flower, a
donkey came and tried to eat it; she kept him off as
long as she could, but at last he seized and devoured
it. This troubled her so much that she woke with
a start, and the dream still weighed upon her
mind.</p>

<p>No one then anticipated what ultimately happened,
but afterwards this quaint dream was looked upon as
a forecast of Margaret's broken marriage. Curiously
enough her dismissal had been provided for by
Louis <span class="smcap">XI.</span> at the time of the Treaty of Arras, as the
following clause in the treaty will show. 'If it
should happen (which God forbid) that my said Lady
Margaret being of age, my said Lord the Dauphin
should not proceed to the perfect consummation of
the said marriage, or that the said marriage should
be broken by the king, Monseigneur the Dauphin,
or others on their part, during the minority of the
young lady or after; in which case, my said lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
shall be sent at the king's expense or at that of my
said Lord the Dauphin, back to my said Lord the
Duke her father, or the Duke Philip her brother,
frankly and fully discharged of all bonds of marriage
and all other obligations, to one of the good towns
in the territories of Brabant, Flanders, or Hainault,
to a safe place acknowledging obedience to the said
Dukes.'</p>

<p>But Margaret remained in France for two years
after Charles's marriage with Anne of Brittany,
which took place on December 6th, 1491. Neglected
by her father, and kept as a sort of hostage until
the Peace of Senlis was signed, she passed her time
in seclusion. 'When the king had restored peace to
Brittany, he returned to France, and gave orders
that Madam Margaret of Flanders should retire to
the castle of Melun on the river Seine, and take with
her the Princess of Tarente'; here she remained for
more than a year. An interesting letter written by
Margaret to Anne de Beaujeu from Melun has
fortunately been preserved. In it she requests that
her cousin might not be taken away from her,
although the king has ordered her to leave, and
mentioning that Madame de Molitart has told her
that she is to be better treated than formerly:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Jean le Maire relates that the autumn of 1491
was very cold and the grapes did not ripen. One
day when Margaret was at table she overheard the
gentlemen of her suite discussing this fact, and with
a play on the words remarked sadly that it was not
surprising if the vines (<i>sarments de vigne</i>) were green
this year, as vows (<i>serments</i>) were of no value (referring
to the king's broken word).</p>

<p>Before Margaret left France she was made to
swear on the Cross and the Gospels that she would
renounce for ever all pretensions to her marriage
with Charles. At last she set out on her long
journey back to Flanders. Charles took care that
she was treated with every respect. Anne of Brittany
showed her great sympathy, and tried by all
means in her power to make Margaret forget her
mortification. At the moment of departure Anne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
ordered Jeanne de Jambes, her most skilful maid of
honour, to make an embroidered coif to offer the
princess, as well as some gold ornaments, the whole
valued at the large sum of £450.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The French nobles who had been attached to
Margaret's person for nearly twelve years accompanied
her on her journey. The little princess was
calm, but she bore a grudge against France which
she never forgot, and which is noticeable in all her
later dealings with her first husband's kingdom.
When she passed through the town of Arras the
citizens cried, 'Noël, Noël,' a French cry that annoyed
Margaret; she called back to them, 'Do not
cry Noël, but long live Burgundy!'</p>

<p>Thus she was escorted to St. Quentin, from thence
to Cambray, Valenciennes, and finally to Malines,
where she was received by her brother Philip and by
Margaret of York, the widow of her grandfather,
Charles the Bold. 'When she alighted from her
litter near a mill by a small stream which divided
the royal and archducal dwelling, she thanked the
said lords and ladies who had brought and accompanied
her, begging them all to recommend her very
humbly to the king their master, bearing no ill-will
because of his separation from her, believing that
marriages ought to be voluntary.'</p>

<p>However, Margaret always showed great regard
for Anne of Brittany, and even more so when the
queen married Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> The documents of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
period abound in exchange of civilities between the
princesses. Thus ended Margaret's first matrimonial
adventure. Her former husband did not long survive
his marriage with Anne, but died almost suddenly
in April 1498, and left no children. His
widow fulfilled the clause in her marriage contract,
and married his successor, who ascended the throne
as Louis <span class="smcap">XII</span>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>PRINCESS OF ASTURIAS</h3>

<p class="p2">Charles <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> was hardly free from his
sister's tutelage when he dreamt of conquering
the kingdom of Naples, which he claimed
as heir to the house of Anjou. An embassy which he
received from Ludovico Sforza, afterwards Duke of
Milan, made him the more determined to carry out
this project.</p>

<p>By the Treaty of Barcelona (January 1493) Charles
had agreed to restore to Ferdinand of Aragon the
counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne in return for
Ferdinand's assurance that he would leave him a free
hand in Italy and elsewhere, and would not form
matrimonial alliances with the houses of England,
Austria, or Naples; but when, in 1494, Charles informed
Ferdinand of his intentions against Naples,
and claimed his aid in accordance with the treaty,
the King of Aragon pretended to be shocked and
surprised, and quietly set to work to circumvent his
plans and to side with his enemies.</p>

<p>On the 10th of July 1494 the Duke of Orleans
crossed the Alps with the advance guard of the
French army. Charles soon followed, and was received
with great honour by Ludovico Sforza and
the Duke of Ferrara. After crossing Italy in
triumph, he arrived at Naples without having broken
a single lance, and made a solemn entry into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the town, whilst the King of Naples, abandoned by
his subjects and betrayed by his generals, fled to
Sicily.</p>

<p>But in the midst of his triumphs Charles learned,
through the historian Commines, his ambassador in
Venice, of the perfidy of his allies and of the new
league that was formed against him by Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> of
England, Ferdinand of Aragon, Maximilian (recently
elected emperor after the death of his father), the
Pope Alexander <span class="smcap">VI</span>., the Republic of Venice, and the
Duke of Milan. All these confederates combined in
a common interest to drive the French out of Italy,
and to attack France from different sides at the same
time.</p>

<p>'The ambitious schemes of Charles <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> established
a community of interests among the great
European states, such as had never before existed,
or at least been understood; and the intimate relations
thus introduced naturally led to intermarriages
between the principal powers, who until this period
seemed to have been severed almost as far asunder
as if oceans had rolled between them.... It was
while Charles <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> was wasting his time at Naples
that the marriages were arranged between the royal
houses of Spain and Austria, by which the weight of
these great powers was thrown into the same scale,
and the balance of Europe unsettled for the greater
part of the following century.</p>

<p>'The Treaty of Venice provided that Prince John,
the heir of the Spanish monarchies, then in his
eighteenth year, should be united with the Princess
Margaret, daughter of the Emperor Maximilian, and
that the Archduke Philip, his son and heir, and
sovereign of the Low Countries in his mother's right,
should marry Joanna, second daughter of Ferdinand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and Isabella. No dowry was to be required with
either princess.'<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The conditions of this double marriage were drawn
up by Francisco de Rojas, sent to Flanders by Ferdinand
and Isabella for this purpose. The proposals
were agreed to by both sides, and it was arranged
that the fleet which brought Joanna of Castile to
Flanders should carry Margaret of Austria to Spain.</p>

<p>The following amusing anecdote is from Zurita,
and mentioned in A. R. Villa's <i>Life of Doña Juana
la Loca</i>. Francisco de Rojas, who was chosen by
Isabella to marry Margaret by proxy, was presented
with a brocade garment by Antonio de Valle on his
arrival in Flanders, and was told that he must see
that he was tidy at the ceremony of betrothal, as
according to the German custom he would have to
undress as far as his doublet and hose. This he promised
to do, but when he came to remove his coat, it
was seen that his shirt protruded from his hose at
the back. This carelessness caused him to be much
teased by the courtiers, who with difficulty concealed
their smiles at the time.</p>

<p>By the end of the summer in 1496 a fleet, consisting
of one hundred and thirty vessels, large and
small, strongly manned and thoroughly equipped,
was got ready for sea in the ports of Guipuzcoa and
Biscay. The whole was placed under the command
of Don Fadrique Enriquez, Admiral of Castile, who
carried with him a splendid array of chivalry. A
more gallant and beautiful Armada never before
quitted the shores of Spain. The Infanta Joanna,
attended by a numerous suite, embarked towards the
end of August at the port of Laredo, on the eastern
borders of Asturias, where she bade farewell to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
mother, Queen Isabella, who travelled through Spain
to take leave of her seventeen-year-old daughter.
On August the 20th the queen wrote to Doctor de
Puebla (Ferdinand's envoy in England) from Laredo
to inform him that the fleet that was taking her
daughter to Flanders, and bringing the Infanta Margaret
to Spain, was to sail the next day. 'If they
should enter an English port, she hopes that they
will be treated in England as though they were the
daughters of Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> himself.'<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The queen also
addressed a letter to the King of England begging
for the same favours. A navy of fifteen thousand
armed men was needed to escort the bride to Flanders
and bring back Prince John's betrothed to Spain.
For two nights after the embarkation Isabella slept
on the ship with her daughter, and when at last the
fleet sailed on August 22nd, she turned her back on
the sea, and rode with a heavy heart back to Burgos.</p>

<p>The weather soon after Joanna's departure became
extremely tempestuous, and the poor princess had a
terrible voyage; her fleet was driven into Portland,
and one of the largest ships came into collision and
foundered. But this was not the end of her troubles,
for on the Flemish coast another great ship was
wrecked, with most of her household, trousseau, and
jewels. Several vessels were lost, and many of her
attendants perished from the hardships they had to
endure, amongst them the old Bishop of Jaen, who
had accompanied her to give state and dignity to her
suite. Eventually the whole fleet arrived at Ramua,
sorely disabled and needing a long delay for refitting
before it could return to Spain.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Soon after her
arrival in Flanders her marriage with the Archduke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Philip was celebrated with much pomp at Lille. At
a tournament given in her honour at Brussels, three
knights wearing her colours entered the lists and
fought against three of Margaret's knights; the latter
were dressed in white, and wore 'marguerites' embroidered
as their badge. Philip neglected and ill-treated
his wife's countrymen to the extent of
allowing nine thousand of the men on the fleet at
Antwerp to die from cold and privation, without
trying to help them; his young wife's Spanish household
were unpaid, and even the income settled upon
her by Philip was withheld, on the pretext that Ferdinand
had not fulfilled his part of the bargain agreed
upon in the marriage settlements.</p>

<p>The fleet was detained until the following winter
to carry the destined bride of the young Prince
of Asturias to Spain. Margaret was now in her
eighteenth year, and already distinguished for those
intellectual qualities which made her later one of the
most remarkable women of her time. She must
have been a lovely girl, tall and fair, with masses
of waving golden hair, a brilliant complexion, soft
brown eyes, and a rather long narrow face, with the
full under-lip so peculiar to the house of Austria.
It is no wonder that Prince John fell in love with
her, or that his parents welcomed her with admiration.
In the spring of 1497 Margaret left Flushing
and started on her long journey to Spain. She
had an even worse voyage than her sister-in-law.
A fearful storm arose, and her vessel was nearly
wrecked. When the tempest had somewhat subsided,
she and her companions amused themselves
with each writing her own epitaph. Margaret composed
the following well-known distich, which she
bound to her arm for identification, and jokingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
said might be engraved on her tomb, in case her
body should be washed ashore:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Cy gist Margot la gentil' Damoiselle,</p>
<p>Qu' ha deux marys et encor est pucelle.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>Fortunately this witty epitaph was not needed.
The fleet passed the English Channel in the beginning
of February, and was compelled through
stress of weather to take refuge in the harbour of
Southampton. On February the 3rd Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>
wrote the following letter to the Princess Margaret:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">Most illustrious and most excellent Princess, our
dearest and most beloved cousin,&mdash;With all our
heart we send to greet you, and to recommend ourself.
We have received through the most renowned,
most prudent, and most discreet ambassador of our
most beloved cousins the King and Queen of
Spain, at our Court, the letters of the admiral and
ambassador of the said King and Queen, who
accompany your Excellence. By them we are
informed that your Highness, enjoying the best of
health, has entered with your whole fleet and suite
our harbour of Southampton. Our subjects of that
neighbourhood had already communicated to us the
arrival of your Highness. As soon as we heard of
it, we sent our well-beloved and trustworthy vassals
and servants, the seneschal of our palace, and Sir
Charles Somerset, our captain and guardian of our
body, and also a doctor <i>utriusque juris</i>, and keeper
of our Privy Seal, to see, visit, and consult you in
our name, and to tell you how agreeable and delightful
to us was the arrival of your Excellence in our
dominions, especially as it has pleased God to give
you and your company (to whom we recommend
ourself likewise) good health and cheerful spirits.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Our servants are to place at your disposal our
person, our realm, and all that is to be found in it.
They are to provide you with whatever you wish,
and serve and obey you as ourself. You will more
fully learn our intentions from them and from the
letters of the Spanish ambassador who resides at
our Court.'</p>


<p>The following is in the king's handwriting:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">'Dearest and most beloved cousin,&mdash;Desirous the
more to assure your Excellence that your visit to us
and to our realm is so agreeable and delightful to us,
that the arrival of our own daughter could not give
us greater joy, we write this portion of our letter
with our own hand, in order to be able the better
to express to you that you are very welcome, and
that you may more perfectly understand our good
wishes. We most earnestly entreat and beseech
your Highness, from the bottom of our heart, to be
as cheerful as though you were with the dearest and
most beloved King and Queen of Spain, our cousins,
and that you will stay in whatever part of our realms
as cheerfully and without fear as though you were
in Spain. In all and everything you want, do not
spare us and our realms, for you will render us a
great and most acceptable service by accepting anything
from us.&mdash;Palace, Westminster, 3rd February.'<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The king then begs her to stay at Southampton,
and even offers to pay her a visit there:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">'Most illustrious and most excellent Princess,
our most noble and most beloved cousin,&mdash;We have
received to-day the letter of the 2nd instant, which
your Highness has written from the harbour of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Southampton, and are much pleased with it. We
are also very glad to learn the good news contained
in your letter and the letter of the illustrious
ambassador, whom our dearest cousins, the King
and Queen of Spain, your most pious parents, have
ordered to accompany you. He informs us of your
prosperity and good success. We, on our part, have
sent to inform you of our inviolable friendship, and
to tell you how agreeable in every respect your
arrival in our harbour has been to us. On Friday we
sent you our servants and domestics, with injunctions
to serve you in the same way as they serve ourselves;
and a short time after they had left we
wrote to your Excellence a letter with our own hand,
to give you a hearty welcome in our harbour. We
beseech you to have a cheerful face and a glad heart,
to be happy and enjoy yourself as safely as though
you were our own daughter, or had already reached
the dominions of our said cousins the King and
Queen of Spain, your pious parents. We pray your
Highness, with all our heart, to dispose of us and of
everything that is to be found in our realms, and to
spare us in nothing, even if the thing is not to be
had in our dominions, and to order any service which
we are able to execute. For, by doing so, you will
bestow on us a signal and most acceptable favour.
As we hear that the wind is contrary to the continuation
of your voyage, wishing that your Highness
would repose and rest, our advice is, that you
take lodgings in our said town of Southampton, and
remain there until the wind becomes favourable and
the weather clears up. We believe that the movement
and the roaring of the sea is disagreeable to
your Highness and to the ladies who accompany
you. If you accept our proposal, and remain so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
long in our said town of Southampton that we can
be informed of it, and have time to go and to see
you before your departure, we certainly will go and
pay your Highness a visit. In a personal communication
we could best open our mind to you, and
tell you how much we are delighted that you have
safely arrived in our port, and how glad we are that
the (friendship) with you and our dearest cousins the
King and Queen of Spain, your most benign parents,
is increasing from day to day. We desire to communicate
to you in the best manner our news, and to
hear from you of your welfare. May your Highness
be as well and as happy as we wish.&mdash;From our
Palace of Westminster.... February.'<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p class="p2">We have no account of Margaret's accepting
Henry's invitation, or of their meeting at this time.
After these various adventures the princess at length
arrived safely at the port of Santander in the early
days of March 1497. An ambassador was sent to
meet her with a train of one hundred and twenty
mules laden with plate and tapestries. The young
Prince of Asturias, accompanied by the king his
father, hastened towards the north to meet his bride,
whom they met at Reynosa and escorted to Burgos.
When Margaret saw her future husband and the
king approach, she attempted to kiss the latter's
hands, which he tried to prevent her from doing, but
she persevered, and kissed the king's hands as well
as those of her future husband. On her arrival at
Burgos she was received with the greatest marks of
pleasure and satisfaction by the queen and the whole
Court. Preparations were at once made for solemnising
the marriage after the expiration of Lent, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
a style of magnificence never before witnessed. The
wedding ceremony took place on Palm Sunday, the
3rd of April, and was performed by the Archbishop
of Toledo in the presence of the grandees and principal
nobility of Castile, the foreign ambassadors and
delegates from Aragon. Among these latter were
the magistrates of the principal cities, wearing their
municipal insignia and crimson robes of office, who
seem to have had quite as important parts assigned
by their democratic communities as any of the
nobility or gentry. The wedding was followed by
a brilliant succession of fêtes, tourneys, tilts of reeds,
and other warlike spectacles, in which the matchless
chivalry of Spain poured into the lists to display
their prowess in the presence of their future queen.
The chronicles of the day remark on the striking
contrast exhibited at these entertainments between
the gay and familiar manners of Margaret and her
Flemish nobles, and the pomp and stately ceremonial
of the Castilian Court, to which the Austrian
princess, brought up as she had been at the Court
of France, could never be wholly reconciled. The
following quaint passage is from Abarca's <i>Reyes de
Aragon</i>:&mdash;'And although they left the princess all
her servants, freedom in behaviour and diversions,
she was warned that in the ceremonial affairs she
was not to treat the royal personages and grandees
with the familiarity and openness usual with the
houses of Austria, Burgundy, and France, but with
the gravity and measured dignity of the kings and
realms of Spain.'</p>

<p>An inventory of the rich plate and jewels presented
to Margaret on the day of her marriage is to be
found in the sixth volume of memoirs of the Spanish
Academy of History. The plate and jewels are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
said to be 'of such value and perfect workmanship
that the like was never seen.'</p>

<p>Nothing seemed wanting to the happiness of the
young bride and bridegroom, and that summer they
made a kind of triumphal progress through the
great cities of the land. The marriage of the heir-apparent
could not have been celebrated at a happier
time. It took place in the midst of negotiations
for a general peace, to which the nation looked for
repose after so many years of uninterrupted war.
The Court of the Spanish sovereigns was at the
height of its splendour; Ferdinand and Isabella
seemed to have reached the zenith of their ambitious
dreams, when death stepped in, and destroyed their
fondest hopes.</p>

<p>Seven months after Prince John's marriage, his
sister, Isabella, was united to the King of Portugal.
The wedding took place at the frontier town of
Valencia de Alcantara, in the presence of the
Catholic sovereigns, without pomp or parade of any
kind.</p>

<p>While they were detained there, an express messenger
brought tidings of the dangerous illness of
their son, the Prince of Asturias. Prince John,
accompanied by his youthful bride, had been on his
way to his sister's wedding when he fell a victim to
a malignant fever at Salamanca. The symptoms
speedily assumed an alarming character. The
prince's constitution, naturally delicate, sunk under
the violence of the attack; and when his father,
who came with all possible speed to Salamanca,
arrived there, no hopes were entertained of his
recovery.</p>

<p>Ferdinand, however, tried to cheer his son with
hopes he did not feel himself; but the young prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
told him that it was too late to be deceived; that
he was prepared to die, and that all he now desired
was that his parents might feel the same resignation
to the divine will which he experienced himself.
Ferdinand took fresh courage from the heroic
example of his son, whose forebodings were unhappily
too soon realised. The doctors fearing to
alarm Margaret, who was expecting shortly to
become a mother, had kept from her the serious
state of her husband's health as long as possible.
Knowing that he was ill, she was anxious to go on a
pilgrimage to pray for his recovery. 'When at last
she was allowed to enter his room on the 4th
October 1497 she was shocked to see the change
which a few days had wrought in him. Her dying
husband bade her farewell in a broken voice, recommending
their unborn child to her tender care.
Margaret pressed her lips to his, but when she found
them already cold, overcome by emotion, she had to
be carried half-dead from the room.' Bowed down
with grief, she did not recover from the shock of her
sudden bereavement, and soon after her husband's
death, gave birth to a still-born child.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>This double tragedy is pathetically described by
the historian, Peter Martyr, who draws an affecting
picture of the anguish of the young widow, and the
bereaved parents. 'Thus was laid low the hope of
all Spain.' 'Never was there a death which occasioned
such deep and general lamentation throughout
the land.' Ferdinand, fearful of the effect which the
sudden news of this calamity might have on the
queen, caused letters to be sent at brief intervals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
containing accounts of the gradual decline of the
prince's health, so as to prepare her for the inevitable
stroke. Isabella, however, received the fatal
tidings in a spirit of humble resignation, saying, 'The
Lord hath given and the Lord hath taken away,
blessed be his name!'<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Another historian relates that Ferdinand, fearing
that the sudden news of John's death would kill
Isabella with grief, caused her to be told that it was
her husband, Ferdinand himself, that had died, so
that when he presented himself before her, the&mdash;as
he supposed&mdash;lesser grief of her son's death should
be mitigated by seeing that her husband was alive.
The experiment does not appear to have been very
successful, as Isabella was profoundly affected when
she heard the truth. (Florez, <i>Reinas Catolicas</i>.)
The blow was one from which she never recovered.
John was her only son, her 'angel' from the time of
his birth, and the dearest wish of her heart had been
the unification of Spain under him and his descendants.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Every honour which affection could devise
was paid to Prince John's memory. The Court, to
testify its unwonted grief, put on sackcloth instead
of white serge usually worn as mourning. All
offices, public and private, were closed for forty days;
and every one dressed in black. The nobles and
wealthy people draped their mules with black cloth
down to the knees, showing only their eyes, and
black flags were suspended from the walls and gates
of the cities. Such extraordinary signs of public
sorrow show in what regard the young prince was
held. Peter Martyr, his tutor, is unbounded in his
admiration of his royal pupil's character, whose
brilliant promise and intellectual and moral excellence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
gave the happiest hopes for the future of his
country. These hopes, alas, were destroyed by his
untimely death, and that of his infant child.</p>

<p>Prince John's funeral was celebrated on a magnificent
scale, and his body laid in the Dominican
Monastery of Saint Thomas at Avila, which had
been erected by his parents. A few years later his
treasurer, Juan Velasquez, caused a beautiful monument
to be raised to his memory, and himself added
a short but pathetic epitaph. This tomb is the
masterpiece of Micer Domenico of Florence, and
resembles the exquisite royal sepulchres at Granada.
It is placed under an elliptical arch, in front of the
high altar, and is one of the finest specimens of an
Italian Renaissance tomb. The handsome young
prince is depicted lying full length on his marble
couch, his hands together as if in prayer. The
whole figure is exquisitely simple and dignified in its
perfect repose; and if the beautiful marble effigy
was true to life, we can understand the overwhelming
grief of Spain at his loss.</p>

<p>After her husband's death Margaret became so
popular 'that she was often obliged to wait in the
fields under the shade of the olives till night fell, as
she dared not enter the towns and cities by day,
because the people pressed with affectionate tumult
round her litter to see her face, crying aloud that
they wished for her alone, for their lady and princess,
although when the Queen of Portugal, the heiress,
made her solemn and pompous entries in broad daylight,
they hardly greeted her.'<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Prince John's
eldest sister, the Queen of Portugal, was next in
the succession, but by her death in the following
year, and that of her infant son two years later,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
her sister Joanna, wife of the Archduke Philip,
became heiress to the thrones of Aragon and
Castile.</p>

<p>Margaret was treated most affectionately by the
king and queen, who made her a very liberal provision,
and tried in every way to comfort and console
her. Whilst she was at the Spanish Court we hear
of her teaching French to her little sister-in-law,
Katharine, who was betrothed to Arthur, Prince of
Wales. On July 17th, 1498, De Puebla is instructed
to write to the Spanish sovereigns that 'the
Queen and the mother of the King wish that the
Princess of Wales should always speak French with
the Princess Margaret, who is now in Spain, in order
to learn the language, and to be able to converse in
it when she comes to England. This is necessary,
because these ladies do not understand Latin, and
much less Spanish. They also wish that the Princess
of Wales should accustom herself to drink wine.
The water of England is not drinkable, and even if
it were, the climate would not allow the drinking
of it.'<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Margaret spent nearly two years at the Spanish
Court. After the first anniversary of her husband's
death had passed, and his memory been duly honoured
by pompous services at Avila, her return to Germany
was discussed. Her Flemish attendants had never
become accustomed to the wearisome etiquette and
stately ceremonial of the Court of Spain, and by
their unreasonable demands stirred up discord between
her and the king and queen. Maximilian
hearing disquieting reports, urged his daughter to
lose no time in returning to him, which the princess
decided to do. Ferdinand and Isabella seem to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
had a real affection for their widowed daughter-in-law,
and when the time for parting came, expressed
much sorrow at losing her. At last she set out on
her long journey back to Flanders (1499). Her
former husband, Charles <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, had died suddenly in
April 1498, leaving his kingdom to his cousin, the
Duke of Orleans, who ascended the throne as
Louis <span class="smcap">XII</span>. Hearing that his old friend and playfellow
was returning to Flanders, Louis wrote a
most affectionate letter offering her a safe conduct
through his dominions. Margaret was now twenty
years old, but in spite of her youth she had seen
much sorrow. Twice through a cruel fate she had
missed the proud position of queen&mdash;first of France,
then of Spain. For the second time she returned to
her father without husband or child; but sorrow had
deepened and enriched her character, and the time
she spent at the Castilian Court was not wasted, as
it gave her an insight into the management of state
affairs and political intrigues, which with her knowledge
of Spanish was of infinite importance to her in
later life, and helped to form the able politician and
wise administrator who, as Governess of the Netherlands,
commanded the admiration and respect of the
cleverest men in Europe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>DUCHESS OF SAVOY</h3>

<p class="p2">On the 7th of March 1500, between seven and
eight o'clock in the evening, a brilliant procession
wound its way through a covered
passage from the Archducal Palace in the old town
of Ghent to the church of Saint John. The line
of route was lit by more than a thousand torches
which flashed on the gorgeous clothes and jewels of
the princes and high officers of state who had come
to grace the baptism of the infant son of the Archduke
Philip and Joanna of Castile. The baby's step-great-grandmother,
Margaret of York, widow of
Charles the Bold, carried him in her arms, seated
on a chair covered with brocade, and borne on the
shoulders of four men from the palace to the church;
at her right walked Margaret, Princess of Castile,
the infant's other godmother, dressed in a mourning
hood and mantle. She had come to her brother's
Court two days before to stand sponsor for her nephew,
who had been born in the palace at Ghent on February
the 24th. The little prince, wrapped in a
cloak of rich brocade lined with ermine, was baptized
by the name of Charles, in memory of his great-grandfather
the last Duke of Burgundy, his father
conferring upon him the title of Duke of Luxembourg.
After the ceremony, which was performed by the
Archbishop of Tournay, trumpets sounded, and money
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
was thrown broadcast about the church, whilst the
heralds cried 'Largesse, largesse!' The procession
then re-formed and returned to the palace in the
order in which it came, arriving between eleven and
twelve at night. A visit was immediately paid to
the Archduchess Joanna, who was informed that her
son had been duly baptized. She received the congratulations
of the assembled guests lying in her
state-bed, which was hung with green damask and
covered with a gorgeous quilt of brocade. Near at
hand were displayed the beautiful presents the infant
had received. Gold and crystal cups, flagons, goblets,
and salt-cellars sparkling with precious stones and
pearls, amongst them his Aunt Margaret's gift, 'a
standing cup of gold with cover weighing four marks,
set with precious stones, a great balass ruby on top,
surrounded by twenty smaller rubies and diamonds.'<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<a href="images/illus071_b.jpg">View larger image</a></p>

<p>The old town of Ghent held high festival in honour
of the birth of the heir of Austria and Burgundy.
The dragon on the belfry ejected Greek fire from
mouth and tail; torches and paper lanterns swung
gaily from the tower of Saint Nicholas to the belfry,
and the object of all this rejoicing was the infant who
was one day to become the Emperor Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> by a
long train of events which opened the way to his
inheritance of more extensive dominions than any
European sovereign since Charlemagne had possessed,
each of his ancestors having acquired kingdoms or
provinces towards which their prospect of succession
was extremely remote. But his early childhood was
clouded, for he hardly knew his parents, who left
the Netherlands for Spain in November 1501, barely
nine months after his birth. When his mother returned
in 1504 her mind was already troubled by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
gloom which settled on her in later years. After
Queen Isabella's death his parents again left for
Spain to take possession of their kingdom of Castile
(April 1506), and Charles did not see his mother
until 1517. But if he never knew a mother's care,
he had an admirable substitute in the affection and
guidance of his aunt.</p>

<p>Margaret spent two years with her father after
she left Spain, during which time she studied the
management of German affairs, and tried to forget
her sorrow in improving her mind and cultivating
her many gifts. Her high birth, beauty, and accomplishments
brought her many suitors amongst the
princes of Europe; we hear of her marriage being
discussed with the Kings of Poland and Scotland,
and even with the Prince of Wales, who was not
yet united to his long-betrothed bride Katharine.
Finally her choice fell upon the young Duke of Savoy,
who had previously married Louisa Jolenta, daughter
of Amadeus <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, Duke of Savoy, but who had no
children. The young Duke Philibert <span class="smcap">II.</span>, surnamed
the Handsome, was born in the castle of Pont d'Ain
on the 10th of April 1480; he was therefore about
the same age as Margaret. His youth had been
spent at the Court of France, and at fourteen he had
accompanied the expedition of Charles <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> against
the kingdom of Naples. The following year, which
was that of his accession to the dukedom, he
had taken part in the war waged by the Emperor
Maximilian against the Florentines. Tall, strong,
courageous, extremely good-looking, an accomplished
rider, devoted to horses, hunting, jousting and feats
of arms, he was indeed a gallant young prince, well
fitted to win the heart of a beautiful and accomplished
princess. Politically this alliance was popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
in Savoy, where it was feared that a too close connection
with France might impair the independence
of the duchy.</p>

<p>On the 26th of September 1501 the marriage contract
was signed at Brussels. The Archduke Philip
settled 300,000 golden crowns on his sister as dowry.
She also enjoyed a revenue of 20,000 as Dowager-Princess
of Spain. It was agreed that if the Duke
Philibert should predecease his wife she should receive
a dowry of 12,000 golden crowns, raised on the
county of Romont and the provinces of Vaud and
Faucigny.</p>

<p>Margaret left Brussels towards the end of October
to join her future husband at Geneva. She travelled
slowly, for the roads were bad and the days short.
Margaret of York accompanied her for half a league
and then took leave; her brother Philip going with
her a short way, he left her a company of Flemish
nobles to escort her as far as Geneva at his expense,
Duke Philibert having sent two hundred and fifty
knights to meet his bride and act as her bodyguard.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the towns she passed through
turned out to give her a hearty welcome and to wish
her good luck. They offered her gifts of wine and
venison, wild boars, partridges, rabbits, and fatted
calves. The Bishop of Troyes gave her the keys of
his cellar whilst she stayed in the episcopal town.
At Dôle the inhabitants made her a present of 'six
puncheons of wine, six sheep, six calves, six dozen
capons, six wild geese, and twelve horses laden with
oats.'</p>

<p>The duke's natural brother René, who was known
as the Bastard of Savoy, married her by proxy on
Sunday, November 28th. He presented the bride with
a heart of diamonds surmounted by a very fine pearl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
and a girdle set with twenty-six diamonds, ten large
carbuncles and pearls (marguerites) without number.
When the evening came, Margaret, dressed in cloth
of gold, lined with crimson satin, and wearing splendid
jewels, was laid on a state-bed, whilst René in complete
armour went through the ceremony of placing
himself beside her, 'all those who had been at the
betrothal being present.' After a few moments he
rose from the bed, begging madame's pardon for
having interrupted her sleep, and asking for a kiss in
payment. The kiss was graciously given, and René,
throwing himself on his knees, swore to be always
her faithful servant. Margaret made him rise, wished
him a good-night, and presented him with a valuable
diamond set in a gold ring.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>From Dôle Margaret travelled to Romain-Motier,
a small village about two miles from Geneva, and
buried in a lonely valley. The ruined cloisters of the
old abbey of black monks may still be seen where
Philibert met Margaret one winter's morning, and
where the marriage was celebrated by Louis de Gorrevod,
Bishop of Maurienne, on the 4th of December
1501.</p>

<p>A brilliant reception awaited the young couple at
Geneva. Magnificent fêtes, jousts, and tourneys were
given in their honour, which 'cost the town a great
deal in games, dances, masquerades, and other amusements.'
Together they made a triumphal progress
through the principal towns to the duchy of Savoy
during the spring and summer. At Chambéry they
received a royal welcome. At Bourg the inhabitants
greeted the bridal pair with enthusiasm, although the
humble burghers had been much perturbed as to how
they should do honour to an emperor's daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
They had just bought fifty thousand bricks wherewith
to erect fortifications, and this expense had
emptied the municipal coffers. After much consultation
they decided to borrow seven hundred florins
from the priests of Our Lady of Bourg. These
ecclesiastics lent the sum required on receiving
authority to reimburse themselves from the revenues
of the town. A deputation was sent to meet the
duke and duchess and to offer them and the Governor
of Bresse four dozen Clon cheeses, four puncheons
of foreign wine, and twelve pots of preserves. The
following detailed account of their reception is to be
found in the archives of the town of Bourg:&mdash;</p>

<p>'At last the long-looked-for day came, and the
duke and duchess arrived at Bourg on the 5th of
August 1502. From early dawn the bells of the
monasteries and churches were ringing, guns firing,
and a stir of general excitement was in the air. The
picturesque wooden houses were hung with coloured
tapestries, decorated with five hundred escutcheons
bearing the arms of Savoy and Burgundy. Eight
platforms had been constructed in different parts of
the town on which were to be enacted masques and
allegories. At the sound of the trumpet the crowd
collected in front of the town-hall, from whence issued
the municipal body, preceded by the syndics in red
robes, one of them bearing the town keys on a silver
salver. The procession marched with trumpets blowing
to the market-place, when soon after a warlike
fanfare and the neighing of horses announced the
arrival of the ducal cortège, headed by Philibert and
Margaret. The sight of the young couple evoked
shouts and cheers. Margaret, wearing the ducal
crown, was mounted on a palfrey, covered with a rich
drapery, embroidered with the arms of Burgundy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
and with nodding white plumes on its head. Through
a veil of silver tissue her sweet face appeared framed
in long tresses of fair hair. A close-fitting dress of
crimson velvet stitched with gold, bordered with the
embossed arms of Austria and Savoy, set off her
graceful figure. With one hand she held the reins
of her horse, with the other she saluted the crowd,
whilst at her right on a fiery charger rode the handsome
Philibert, delighted with the enthusiasm which
burst forth at the progress of his lovely wife.</p>

<p>'The syndics, kneeling on one knee, presented the
duke and duchess with the keys of the town. John
Palluat, head of the municipality, made a lengthy
speech according to the fashion of the time, full of
whimsical expressions, puns and witticisms, comparing
Princess Margaret's qualities with those of the flower
that bore her name.</p>

<p>'Having entered the town the ducal procession
alighted, and two gentlemen&mdash;Geoffroy Guillot and
Thomas Bergier&mdash;advanced towards the princess: the
former had been chosen by the council to explain the
mysteries, moralities, and allegories; the latter to
hold a small canopy over the princess's head. At the
market gate on a large platform a huge elephant was
seen carrying a tower. This tower, emblem of the
town, had four turrets, in each of which was a young
girl typifying one of the four attributes of the capital
of Bresse. These attributes were goodness, obedience,
reason, and justice. After listening to verses sung
in her praise by the four attributes, the princess, still
preceded by Geoffroy Guillot, arrived at the market-place,
where on another platform was represented
the invocation of Saint Margaret, virgin and martyr.
The saint with a halo, treading an enormous dragon
under foot, was smiling at Margaret. She held her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
right hand over her as a sign of her protection in this
world, and with her left pointed to the sky and the
eternal throne that God had prepared for her. A
group of angels sang a hymn about heaven envying
earth the possession of Margaret; whilst the priests
of Notre-Dame and the preaching friars enacted the
legend of Saint George and the Archangel Michael
on the platforms before their church.</p>

<p>'Further on, before the Maison de Challes, the
exploits of gods and heroes of mythology were shown.
Two persons, one wrapped in a lion's skin and carrying
on his shoulder an enormous club of cardboard,
the other in a helmet and draped in a red tunic, were
supposed to represent the departure of Hercules and
Jason to conquer the Golden Fleece. At the other
end of the theatre Medea, dressed in a silk robe, gave
vent to the fury she felt at her adventurous husband's
indifference.</p>

<p>'Before the fountain of the town the crowd was so
dense that the guard and Geoffroy Guillot found it
difficult to force a passage for the duchess. There the
monks of Scillon had arranged a curious fountain in
the shape of a gigantic maiden from whose breasts of
tinted metal two jets of wine flowed into a large basin;
her body held a puncheon of wine which was cleverly
replaced when exhausted. Finally, in front of the
entrance to the ducal palace, Margaret witnessed the
conquest of the Golden Fleece. Before carrying off
this precious spoil Hercules and Jason had to fight a
multitude of monsters, dragons and buffaloes, which
were disposed of with their club and sword. The
crowd having loudly cheered this curious exhibition,
the duke and duchess entered the castle situated in
the highest part of the city.</p>

<p>'The syndics in the name of the town then presented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the gift they had prepared for the duchess,
a gold medal weighing one hundred and fifty ducats.
This medal, struck at Bourg, showed on the obverse
the effigy of the duke and duchess on a field
strewn with fleurs-de-lys and love-knots, with this
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PHILIBERTUS DUX SABAUDIAE, VIIIUS.<br />
MARGARITA MAXI., AUG. FI. D. SAB.</p>

<p>On the reverse was a shield with the arms of Savoy
and Austria impaled, surmounted by a large love-knot
and surrounded with this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">GLORIA IN ALTISSIMIS DEO, ET IN TERRA PAX HOMINIBUS.<br />
BURGUS.</p>

<p>Thus ended the town of Bourg's splendid reception
of their young duke and duchess.'<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Philibert and Margaret continued their tour of the
duchy, and returned to Bourg in April 1503, when
they took up their residence at the castle of Pont
d'Ain, where the happiest years of Margaret's short
married life were passed.</p>

<p>From this favourite castle of the Dukes of Savoy
on the river Ain, there is a splendid view of the
undulating country, distant hills and forests, which
in the days of Philibert were well stocked with game.
It would be hard to find a more beautiful spot, and it
is no wonder that Margaret loved it and spent most
of her time there.</p>

<p>When Philibert succeeded to the dukedom after
his father's death, his first act had been to give an
appanage to his natural brother René. He bestowed
upon him the county of Villars, the castle of Apremont,
and the Seignory of Gourdans. This brother,
who was known as the Bastard of Savoy, was of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
ambitious and grasping nature. Knowing that Philibert
hated business and preferred spending his time
in hunting and warlike sports, René worked on his
indolence until he practically had the management of
the duchy in his own hands. He persuaded Philibert
to grant him an act of legitimacy and also to give him
the title of Lieutenant-General of the States of Savoy.
When Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> wished to pass through the duchy
to reach Milan he communicated with René. The
French monarch made him many promises, which
were mentioned in the treaty concluded at Château-Renard
with the Cardinal d'Amboise. Duke Philibert,
in virtue of this treaty, allowed the passage of
the French troops, received Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> at Turin, displayed
an extraordinary magnificence, and even
accompanied the king to Milan with two hundred
men-at-arms. In return for his civility Louis granted
him an annual pension of 20,000 golden crowns from
the revenues of this duchy.</p>

<p>René's influence over his half-brother was put to
a hard test when Margaret became Philibert's wife.
The young couple truly loved each other, but the
princess could not brook this divided authority. She
did all in her power to get rid of René, whom she
heartily disliked. The struggle was keen but decisive.
Margaret made use of her father's authority, who as
the Duke of Savoy's suzerain nullified the deed of
René's legitimisation. She also had recourse to
religious intervention to accuse him of extortion.
At her instigation Friar Malet, the Court preacher,
drew a picture of the people's misery and sufferings
in a sermon. Addressing Philibert, he exhorted him
to 'drive out the thieves who were in his household,
who,' he said, 'were leeches sucking the blood of his
unhappy subjects.' René was not long in perceiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
that his credit at the Court of Savoy was gone. He
came to his brother and asked permission to retire
to his property. 'I wish,' Philibert answered, 'that
you would not only retire from my Court, but also
from my State, and that within two days on pain of
death.' René took refuge at the Court of France, but
even there Margaret's dislike followed him, and all
his goods were confiscated after a mock trial.</p>

<p>Philibert had only changed his Prime Minister.
After René's departure Margaret took up the reins
of government and ruled Savoy and Bresse unhindered.
She obtained many privileges from her
father, amongst others the temporal jurisdiction over
all the bishoprics of Savoy, Piedmont, Bugey, and the
provinces of Geneva and Vaud. This concession extended
Savoy's right of sovereignty over all lands
east of the river Saône, which is still called locally
'the side of the Empire.'</p>

<p>In April 1503 the Archduke Philip paid his sister
a visit at Bourg on his return from Spain, where
he had been to take possession of the crown of Castile,
which through the death of Queen Isabella had
descended to his wife Joanna. A grand tournament
was held on the <i>Place des Lices</i> in honour of his visit.
Philip was then escorted by his sister and her husband
to the castle of Pont d'Ain, where fresh festivities
were prepared. The nobility of Bresse and Bugey
flocked there to welcome the royal guests, and there
is even a tradition that the 'Holy Shroud,' usually
kept at Turin, and which had long been in the possession
of the House of Savoy, was there exposed for the
archduke's veneration.</p>

<p>During the next few years the peace of Europe
was unbroken, and Philibert was unable to satisfy his
warlike inclinations. His exuberant spirits found an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
outlet in hunting, jousts, and tournaments. He loved
splendid armour, gorgeous apparel, and brilliant fêtes.
A contemporary chronicler has left an account of the
entertainments given by the Court of Savoy in 1504
on the occasion of the marriage of Laurent de Gorrevod
(who later became Governor of Bresse and Count
of Pont-de-Vaux) with the daughter of Hugues de
la Pallu, Count of Varax, Marshal of Savoy. All
the nobility of Piedmont and Savoy were assembled
at the castle of Carignan on the 18th of February,
Shrove Tuesday, where a tournament took place in
the presence of Philibert, 'Madam Margaret of
Austria, Madame Blanche, Dowager of Savoy, and
many other young and beautiful ladies, as much to
pass the time as to please the ladies.'</p>

<p>A long and wearisome description of the tournament
is given, in which Philibert and his brother
Charles carried off several prizes. Such were the
duke's favourite pastimes, whether at Turin, Carignan,
or at Bourg, where the lists were opened under
the castle walls.</p>

<p>Philibert had inherited his passion for hunting from
a long line of ancestors who were all devoted to this
sport. The castle of Pont d'Ain, standing high on a
hill overlooking Bresse and Bugey, with the river
Ain flowing at its feet well stocked with fish, and its
plains and vast forests abounding with game, was an
ideal home for a sportsman like Philibert. Here he
and Margaret enjoyed the pleasures of a country life.
Accompanied by their nobles and friends the duke and
duchess often started at dawn of day on their hunting
excursions, returning with the last rays of the evening
sun. We are told by Jean le Maire that one day
Margaret had an accident which might have proved
very serious. When she and her husband were hunting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
in the fields near the town of Quier in Piedmont,
the powerful horse on which she was mounted became
quite unmanageable, and kicking and plunging, threw
her violently to the ground. She fell under its feet,
the iron-shod hoofs trampling on her dress, disarranging
her hair, and breaking a thick golden chain
which hung from her neck. All those who witnessed
the accident were paralysed with terror, believing the
duchess could not escape alive, and recalling a similar
accident in which her mother, Mary of Burgundy,
had lost her life. But Margaret had a miraculous
escape, and got up without any harm beyond a severe
shaking.</p>

<p>One morning, early in September 1504, Philibert
went out hunting, leaving Margaret at Pont d'Ain,
and though the weather was extremely hot, followed
a wild boar for several hours. All his followers
were left behind, and his horses having succumbed
to the heat and hard riding, he descended a narrow
valley about midday on foot, and at last arrived
breathless and bathed in perspiration at Saint Vulbas'
fountain. Delighted with the freshness of the spot,
he ordered his meal to be served in a shady grove;
but before long he was seized with a sudden chill,
and pressing his hand to his side in great pain,
mounted a horse which was brought to him, and
with difficulty rode back to Pont d'Ain, his nobles
and huntsmen sadly following. On arriving at the
castle the duke threw himself heavily on a bed, and
Margaret was immediately summoned. She tried
by all means in her power to relieve him, sending
in great haste for the doctors. When they came
she gave them her precious pearls to grind to
powder, and watched them make an elixir with these
jewels which she hoped would save the duke's life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
She made many vows, and sent offerings to distant
shrines, invoking the help of heaven by her prayers.
But Philibert was seized with pleurisy; his vigorous
constitution resisted the violence of the attack for
some days. The physicians bled him, but all their
doctoring was in vain, and soon they had to confess
that they could do nothing more. 'He himself feeling
his end approaching got up, and wished to go
and say an eternal farewell to his very dear companion,
embracing her closely. After having asked
for the last sacraments, and by many acts of faith
and devotion shown his love for the holy Christian
faith, Duke Philibert expired in Margaret's arms on
the 10th of September 1504, at nine o'clock in the
morning, in the twenty-fourth year of his age, in the
same room in the castle of Pont d'Ain where he
had first seen the light.' Margaret's grief was heart-rending:
we are told that her sobs and cries echoed
through the castle. The whole duchy of Savoy
mourned with her for the gallant young prince, so
suddenly cut off in the flower of his age.</p>

<p>The duke's body was embalmed, and attired in
ducal robes, with the rich insignia of his rank, laid on
a state-bed in a spacious chamber, where a crowd of
his subjects came to gaze their last on their young
lord. The body was then placed in a leaden coffin
on which the deceased's titles were engraved, and his
funeral carried out with much pomp. The magistrates
of Bourg had a hundred torches made bearing
the arms of the town; they were carried by burghers
who went to escort the body from the castle of Pont
d'Ain to the church of Notre-Dame, though Margaret
wished her husband to be laid in the priory church
of Brou, near his mother, Margaret of Bourbon's
tomb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
In 1480 Philibert's father, whilst hunting near the
same spot, where later his son contracted his fatal
illness, had fallen from his horse and broken his arm.
He also was carried to Pont d'Ain, and his life was
in danger. His wife, Margaret of Bourbon, then
made a vow that if her husband's life was spared she
would found a monastery of the order of Saint
Benedict at Brou. The duke recovered, but the
duchess died in 1483 before she fulfilled the vow, the
accomplishment of which she bequeathed to her son
Philibert, whose early death also prevented him from
carrying out his mother's wishes. Margaret now
took upon herself the duty of founding the monastery,
and also of erecting for them both, and, above all, for
him whom she loved, 'a great tomb which should be
their nuptial couch,' where she herself would be laid
to rest when her time should come.</p>

<p>Stricken with grief, a childless widow, deprived
for the second time of the husband she loved, at the
age of twenty-four she felt as though all joy in life
had ended, and 'immediately after her husband's
death she cut off her beautiful golden hair, and had
the same done to her own ladies.'<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Margaret passed some years of her widowhood at
the castle of Pont d'Ain, where several traces of her
sojourn remain. She made some additions to the
building; the principal staircase still bears her name.
Here she lived in seclusion, mourning her lot, and
describing her loneliness and sorrow in prose and in
verse. In spite of the imperfections of a free versification
Margaret's poems show a certain harmony,
smoothness, and charm in the informal stanzas, of
which the following is a good specimen:&mdash;</p>

<p>These verses, and many others, were written at
Bourg, or at the castle of Pont d'Ain. This castle,
built towards the end of the tenth century by the
Sires de Coligny, Lords of Revermont, had passed
through marriage to the Dauphins du Viennois in
1225, and in 1285 to the Duke of Burgundy. In
1289 this duke exchanged it, as well as the lordship
of Revermont, with Amé <span class="smcap">IV</span>., Count of Savoy, who
was Seigneur of Bresse in right of his wife, Sybille
de Baugé. The buildings having been much damaged
in the wars, Amé's son, Aimon, rebuilt them. The
last warlike episode in the history of the castle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
occurred in 1325 when Edward, Count of Savoy, came
to take refuge in the fortress after his defeat near
Varey. The pleasant situation of the castle at the
extremity of the chain of Revermont, its proximity
to France, and equable climate made it the favourite
home of the Dukes of Savoy. Below in the valley,
which extends to the Rhone, the waters of the river
Ain join those of the Suran. To the south and east
are the mountain ranges near Bas Bugey, with
wooded slopes and prosperous villages, to the north
and west the undulating plain of Bresse, crowned by
forests. The Princesses of Savoy loved this spot.
Amedeo <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> lived here for a long time with his
wife Yolande of France. Philibert and his sister
Louise (the mother of Francis <span class="smcap">I</span>.) were born here,
and here their mother, Margaret of Bourbon, came
to spend her last days. In this peaceful spot
Margaret passed the first years of her mourning,
attached to Bresse by memories of her love and
sorrow.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE BUILDING OF BROU</h3>

<p class="p2">Besides her many poems Margaret has
perpetuated the memory of the chief phases
in her life by means of devices, a symbolical
language much in vogue in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>When she returned to Flanders, after her first
marriage with Charles <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> was annulled, the device
she chose was a high mountain with a hurricane
raging round the summit, and underneath, 'Perflant
altissima venti.' This device ingeniously expressed
the idea that those in a high position are more
exposed than others to the winds of adversity. After
the death of Prince John of Castile and her child,
Margaret adopted another device, a tree laden with
fruit, struck in half by lightning, with this inscription,
'Spoliat mors munera nostra.' This device is attributed
to Strada.</p>

<p>Lastly, as the widow of Duke Philibert, she composed
the famous motto which we find reproduced
everywhere on the tombs, walls, woodwork, and
stained-glass windows of the church at Brou:</p>

<p class="center">FORTUNE.INFORTUNE.FORT.UNE.</p>

<p>And this was her last motto, which she kept to the
end. This enigmatical inscription has been variously
interpreted. Cornelius Agrippa, her panegyrist, and
Gropheus, Chevalier d'Honneur to the princess, who
composed a Latin poem in her praise in 1532, saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
no other meaning in this device than the résumé of
her life ... a plaything of fortune; and they explain
the word 'infortune' by the third person of the present
indicative of the verb 'infortuner,' Fortuna Infortunat
Fortiter Unam&mdash;'La fortune infortune (tries, persecutes)
fort une femme.' Guichenon adopts this
version and says the princess composed her device
'to show that she had been much persecuted by
fortune, having been repudiated by Charles <span class="smcap">VIII</span>., and
having lost both her husbands, the Prince of Castile,
and the Duke of Savoy. This,' he adds, 'is the true
meaning of this device, although another interpretation
has been given to it: Fortune Infortune Fortune.
Fortune to have been affianced to the King of France,
misfortune to have been repudiated by him, and
fortune to have married the Duke of Savoy; but
this explanation does not agree with the device.' In
fact, it is not admissible, for it supposes the device to
be composed of three words only, whilst on the marble
it is clearly composed of four:</p>

<p class="center">FORTUNE.INFORTUNE.FORT.UNE.</p>

<p>The small church of the monastery of Brou, founded
in the beginning of the tenth century by Saint Gérard,
had a great reputation for holiness. It was here
the bodies of Philibert and his mother were laid.
Margaret's thoughts were constantly occupied with
the monument she wished to erect to her husband's
memory, the magnificence of which should satisfy
her artistic taste. She proposed devoting her dowry
to this object in order to raise the necessary funds.
Philibert's brother had succeeded to the ducal crown
under the title of Charles <span class="smcap">III</span>., but the state of the
duchy's finances made it difficult for him to pay
Margaret's dowry, which consisted of 12,000 écus d'or
per annum in French coin, or in lieu of this sum the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
usufruct of Bresse and the provinces of Vaud and
Faucigny. Charles <span class="smcap">III.</span> on his accession had found
the revenues greatly reduced; besides Margaret's
dowry, three other dowager-princesses enjoyed the
income from a great part of his estates. Blanche de
Montferrat, widow of Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span>, had the best part
of Piedmont; Le Bugey was in the hands of Claudine
of Brittany, widow of Duke Philip; lastly, Louise of
Savoy received the largest portion of Chablais. This
was the state of things when Margaret complained of
the insufficiency of the revenues from the properties
of Bresse, Vaud, and Faucigny, revenues far from
equivalent to the sum of 12,000 écus d'or per annum
according to the terms of her marriage contract. As
Charles remained deaf to her complaints, Margaret
had recourse to her father, and travelled to Germany
to persuade Maximilian to give her his support.
Charles at last agreed to send four jurisconsuls
empowered to arrange this business. During the
meetings which took place at Strasburg, Margaret
explained the motives which made her insist on the
fulfilment of the clauses with reference to her dowry.
'Her intention being to found a church and monastery
on the site of the Priory of Brou, the resting-place of
the Lady Margaret of Bourbon and Duke Philibert,
she must needs collect all her resources to meet the
expense which such an endowment would require.
She also pointed out that, according to the Lady
Margaret of Bourbon's will, the church and monastery
were to be erected at the expense of her heirs and
successors. Now this charge falling on Duke Charles,
he could not conscientiously dispense with carrying
out his mother's last wishes, but as she, Margaret,
offered to fulfil this task at her own expense, he was
ill-advised to dispute with her what was legally her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
due. Charles <span class="smcap">III.</span>'s envoys had nothing to say to
this argument excepting the state of penury and
embarrassment in which their master found himself.'</p>

<p>At last, on the 5th of May 1505, in the presence of
Maximilian, a treaty was signed in the hall of the
Knights of St. John of Jerusalem at Strasburg, by
which Duke Charles granted to Margaret the county
of Villars and the Seignory of Gourdans, with all
rights of government as well as power of redeeming
the mortgaged lands of Bresse to the amount of 1200
florins. After the ratification of this treaty Margaret
returned to the castle of Pont-d'Ain and prepared to
carry out her plans.</p>

<p>She first called her Council together and explained
her intentions. Margaret of Bourbon's vow was to
build a church in honour of Saint Benedict, but as
this order had already become lax, Margaret wished
that the church and monastery should be placed
under the protection of St. Nicolas de Tolentin, who
had lately been canonised, and was noted for the
number of miracles worked by his intercession, and
for whom she felt a particular devotion.</p>

<p>The princess's Council, foreseeing the enormous
expense which the execution of this plan would involve,
tried to dissuade her from it, and endeavoured
to turn her mind to completing the church of Notre-Dame
de Bourg, which Jean de Loriol was then
building. At the time of the young duke's death
they had promised to bring his body to rest in the
Abbey of Haute-Combe near the Dukes of Savoy,
his predecessors. But she would not listen to this
argument, and replied 'that she had been informed
of the vow which the late lord and lady, her husband's
parents, had made to found a monastery of the order
of St. Augustine on the site of Brou, but the former,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
after he succeeded, forgot to fulfil it, and neglected
the duty of accomplishing his vow, and that it had
pleased God to take her lord and husband in his
youth in such a way that he had not leisure nor time
to fulfil his father and mother's vow, but that she,
with the help of God, would do so.'<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The series of objections from the Council, and
Margaret's firm determination, are still more apparent
in the following quaint dialogue recorded by a witness
in Paradin's <i>Chronique de Savoie</i>:&mdash;'When several
prominent people pointed out that as she was the
daughter of a great Emperor, and had been Queen
of France, and had since married so great and famous
a Prince, she would be put to heavy and intolerable
expense in order to accomplish something worthy
of her greatness, she replied that God would take
care of the expense. They, moreover, said to her:
"Madame, possibly you regret that the body of
Madame, his mother, is buried in this little place of
Brou; a dispensation could easily be procured from
the Pope to carry it elsewhere"; she answered, no
dispensation was needed for a thing one could do
oneself; they also put before her that after she had
done what she intended, if a war should break out
in this country, the enemy could retire and quarter
themselves there, and from thence fight the town,
which in the end would mean the destruction of the
monastery. Margaret replied: "The power of princes
is nowadays so greatly increased by artillery that
should Bourg be besieged there would be no need to
wait for the attack." They then pointed out that in
the church of Notre-Dame de Bourg there was a
very fine beginning, and that if it pleased her to
employ what she wished to spend on this monastery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
she would have the prayers of ten million people, for
every one in Bourg goes once a day to pray in the
said church of Notre-Dame. To that my said lady
replied, shedding big tears: "You say truly, and it is
my greatest regret, but if I did as you say, the vow
would not be accomplished which by the help of God
I shall fulfil." These are the objections that were
made, and the replies which she gave when they
tried to persuade her to give up this enterprise.'
Margaret had already had the plans and estimates
drawn up for the church and monastery of Brou,
with the help of Laurent de Gorrevod, Governor of
Bresse. The estimate was given to the workmen in
the early spring of 1505, and the first stone of the
sanctuary laid by the princess herself in the spring
of the following year.</p>

<p>On the 11th February 1503 Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> had lost
his queen, Elizabeth of York, who died in the Tower
of London, a week after giving birth to her seventh
child. She had been a good and submissive wife
to Henry, whose claim to the throne she had
strengthened by her own greater right. The bereaved
husband retired 'heavy and dolorous' to a
solitary place to pass his sorrow, but before many
weeks were over he and his crony De Puebla put
their heads together and agreed that the king must
marry again. Amongst other alliances the widowed
Queen of Naples was suggested, but the lady decidedly
objected to the marriage. In November 1504 Queen
Isabella of Castile died, and the crown descended to
her weak-minded daughter Joanna. A struggle was
seen to be impending for the regency, and Henry
was courted by both sides in the dispute. He had
taken as his motto 'Qui je défends est maître,' and
both Ferdinand, King of Spain, and the Emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Maximilian were anxious to win him to their side.
Margaret was secretly offered to Henry as a bride by
Philip and Maximilian, and a close alliance between
them proposed. Margaret, with her large dowries
from Castile and Savoy, was now one of the richest
princesses in Europe. Whilst Ferdinand was trying
to ingratiate himself with Henry, it was clear to the
astute King of England that he had now more to
hope for from Philip and Maximilian, who were
friendly with France, than from Ferdinand.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Early in August 1505 De Puebla went to Richmond
to see the Princess of Wales, and as he entered
the palace one of the household told him that an
ambassador had just arrived from the Archduke
Philip, King of Castile, and was waiting for an
audience. De Puebla at once conveyed the news
to Katharine, and served as interpreter between the
ambassador and the princess. After delivering greetings
from the Emperor Maximilian, the Archduke
Philip, and the Duchess of Savoy, the ambassador
said his mission was a secret one to settle with the
King of England about his marriage with the Duchess
of Savoy, of whom he had brought two portraits.
The Princess of Wales wished to see them, and the
ambassador went to fetch them. One was painted
on wood, the other on canvas. The princess was of
opinion that Michel would have made better portraits.
She asked the ambassador when the King-Archduke
and the Queen-Archduchess were to leave for Spain.
The ambassador replied as soon as possible, but that
he had come to consult the King of England as to all
arrangements.'<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
On the 7th January 1506, after having presided at
the Chapter of the Golden Fleece in the old Abbey
of Middlebourg, the Archduke Philip, King of
Castile, set out from Zealand with his wife, Queen
Joanna, their second son, Ferdinand, an infant of a few
months old, and a retinue amounting to two or three
thousand persons. They embarked (January 8th) on
board a splendid and numerous armada composed
of more than twenty-four vessels, intending to go to
Spain. All went well until the Cornish coast was
passed, and then a dead calm fell, followed by a
furious south-westerly gale, which scattered the
ships, and left that on which Philip and Joanna
were without any escort. A gale which lasted
thirty-six hours dispersed the fleet. Despair seized
the crew, and all gave themselves up for lost.
Philip's attendants dressed him in an inflated leather
garment, upon the back of which was painted in
large letters 'the king, Don Philip,' and thus arrayed
he knelt before a blessed image in prayer, alternating
with groans, expecting every moment would be his
last. Joanna is represented by one contemporary
authority as being seated on the ground between her
husband's knees, saying that if they went down she
would cling so closely to him that they should never
be separated in death, as they had not been in life.
The Spanish witnesses are loud in her praise in this
danger. 'The queen,' they say, 'showed no signs of
fear, and asked them to bring her a box with something
to eat. As some of the gentlemen were
collecting votive gifts to the Virgin of Guadalupe,
they passed the bag to the queen, who, taking out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
her purse containing about a hundred doubloons,
hunted amongst them until she found the only half-doubloon
there, showing thus how cool she was in
the danger. A king never was drowned yet, so she
was not afraid, she said.'<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Sandoval also mentions that Joanna displayed
much composure during the storm. When informed
by Philip of their danger, she attired herself in her
richest dress, securing a considerable amount of
money to her person, in order that her body, if found,
might be recognised, and receive the obsequies suited
to her rank.</p>

<p>Driven to land at Melcombe Regis, on January
16th, Philip sent to acquaint Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> with his
arrival, calling him 'father,' and expressing himself
desirous of seeing him and his Court. Immediately
the king hastened to show the archducal pair every
mark of respect, and sent letters to gentlemen dwelling
near the seaside to attend upon them, and afterwards
despatched palfreys, litters, etc. They were
entertained by Sir Thomas Trenchard at Wolveton
in Dorsetshire; and he is traditionally said to have
summoned his kinsman, John Russell, to assist him,
because the latter having been in Spain, was well
qualified to act as interpreter. Portraits of Philip
and Joanna have been preserved in the Trenchard
family, as well as a white china bowl on a foot bound
with silver, said to have been left by them at
Wolveton. On the 31st January Henry received
the King-Archduke at Windsor, the two monarchs
saluting each other with glad and loving countenances.
The next two days being Sunday and
Candlemas were devoted to religious exercises, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the following week to recreation. It is curious to
read amongst all the state details that when 'the
King of Castile played with the racquet, he gave the
Lord Marquis (of Dorset) fifteen.' On the 9th
February Philip was invested with the Order of the
Garter. 'Immediately after mass, certain of the
King of England's and the King of Castile's Council
presented their respective sovereigns with the draft
of the treaty of peace, having divers new articles
and confirmations inserted therein. The kings,
seated in their stalls, in St. George's Chapel,
signed the writings with their own hands, and the
pledges were solemnly sworn upon a fragment of
the true cross, by which the rebel Earl of Suffolk
was to be surrendered to his doom, and Philip's
sister Margaret married to Henry, and England
bound to the King of Castile against Ferdinand of
Aragon.'</p>

<p>Joanna was deliberately kept in the background
during her stay in England. She had followed her
husband slowly from Melcombe, and arrived at
Windsor ten days later, the day after Philip with
great ceremony had been invested with the Order of
the Garter, and had signed the treaty. On her
arrival at Windsor she was welcomed by the King of
England and her sister, the Princess of Wales,
though she was not allowed to see the latter alone.
The Cottonian MSS. tells us that Queen Joanna did
not see her sister until just before her departure;
they were not even then more than an hour together,
and were never left alone, and Katharine left the
next day for Richmond. 'On the twelfth the King
of England went to Richmond to prepare his house
there for the King of Castile, who joined him on the
fourteenth, the Queen of Castile proceeding on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
same day to the seaside to her ships lying at Dartmouth
and Plymouth.' The rest of the time Philip
was at Richmond was spent in recreation, and 'all
the season the King of Castile was in the King of
England's Court every holiday.' On the 2nd of
March he took his leave, the King of England
accompanying him on his way a mile or more, defraying
the charges of all his servants, and giving
rewards.' During the whole time of Philip and
Joanna's sojourn in England their expenses and those
of their suites were paid by the king's officials, and
they were entertained with dubious hospitality for
nearly three months. During this time Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>
availed himself of the situation to extort three
treaties from his guest not altogether reconcilable
with sound policy or honour. The first was a treaty
of alliance, the second that of his marriage with the
Archduchess Margaret, and the third a treaty of
commerce. The latter was so disastrous to Flemish
interests as to be known by the name of 'Malus
intercursus.' It was agreed that the three treaties
should be confirmed, sealed, and delivered at Calais,
at fixed dates; but when the English envoys reached
Calais they waited in vain for Philip's messengers.
Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, writing on August 19th to Maximilian,
informs him that 'the new ratifications were to be
exchanged in the town of Calais, the treaty of
alliance and marriage before the 20th of June, and
that of commerce before the last day of July. His
ambassadors were at Calais by the appointed time,
with all the necessary papers, but the ambassadors
of King Philip have not arrived up to this day; nor
has he heard anything of the approval of the Pope,
which had been promised him, nor of the securities
for the dowry and the consent of the archduchess.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
However, he is willing to consent to a prorogation of
the term to the end of August.'</p>

<p>On the 23rd of April 1506 Philip and Joanna
having reassembled their fleet, embarked at Weymouth,
and reached Corunna, in the north-western
corner of Galicia, after a prosperous voyage, on
April 28th.</p>

<p>The following summary of the treaty between
Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> and Philip, King of Castile, concerning
the intended marriage with the Archduchess Margaret,
is interesting:&mdash;</p>

<p>The King of Castile binds himself to pay to the
King of England 300,000 crowns, each crown of
four shillings sterling, as the marriage portion of the
Archduchess Margaret; he also promises punctually
to pay the 18,850 crowns a year to which she
is entitled as her jointure in Spain; he moreover
binds himself to pay to Henry 12,000 crowns a
year instead of the revenues from the towns,
castles, and lands, which have been assigned to the
archduchess as her jointure in Savoy. The King
and Queen of Castile bind themselves to consent to
the marriage, and to permit Henry's proxies to
conclude a marriage <i>per verba de præsenti</i> with the
Archduchess Margaret. The King of Castile
promises to send his sister at his own expense
to the town of Greenwich within a month after the
first instalment of 100,000 crowns has been paid.
King Henry promises to perform the marriage
ceremonies within a month of the archduchess's arrival
at Greenwich. Provisions are then made in case of
the archduchess's or Henry's death with or without
children by the marriage. The archduchess is at
liberty to dispose by will of her jewels and ornaments.
Should there be children by the marriage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
they are to succeed to all inheritances in Spain,
Flanders, etc., that the archduchess may become
entitled to. King Philip promises to request the
Pope to confirm this treaty, and both the King of
Castile and his father, the emperor, promise to use
all their influence with the Archduchess Margaret to
persuade her to consent to this marriage.</p>

<p>King Philip signed the treaty at Windsor, March
1st, 1506, and Queen Joanna at Exeter, March
18th, 1506. The ratification of the treaty by
Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> follows; it is dated, Palace of Westminster,
15th May 1506.</p>

<p>On the 20th July Maximilian wrote to King
Henry from Vienna that 'he had heard with great
joy that the marriage between Henry and the Archduchess
Margaret is arranged.' He begs him to
send ambassadors to Malines, and has already
despatched ambassadors to the same place. But on
the 30th of July John le Sauvage wrote to Maximilian
that 'the Archduchess Margaret decidedly
refuses to marry Henry <span class="smcap">VII</span>., although he, at first by
himself, and afterwards conjointly with the Imperial
ambassador, had daily pressed her during a whole
month to consent.' But John le Sauvage adds, 'The
alliance with England is not endangered thereby.
For Henry desires the marriage between his second
daughter and the Prince of Castile (Margaret's
nephew Charles) more than his own with the
archduchess.'</p>

<p>On August 6th G. de Croy wrote to the emperor
that 'he is afraid that the refusal of the archduchess
will cool the friendship of Henry.' On August 8th
Ulrich, Count of Montfort, and Claude Carondelet
also sent a letter to Maximilian to inform him that
'they have travelled with all haste to Savoy in order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
to see the Archduchess Margaret, whom they found
in company of the President of Flanders. They
pressed her very strongly to consent to marry the
King of England. Her answer, however, was that
'although an obedient daughter, she will never agree
to so unreasonable a marriage.' On the 16th of
August Monsieur de Croy and other councillors write
to the King of Castile 'that they have written to
the King of England ... and have received this
very day his answer, and send the letter of the King
of England to him; they are much afraid that the
King of England has cooled in his friendship in
consequence of the answer which the Archduchess
Margaret has given to the President of Flanders,
and afterwards to the Count Montfort and the Bailly
of Amont, ambassadors of the emperor, and again
to the President of the King of Castile.' On
September 24th Maximilian wrote to King Henry
that 'he had not been able to persuade his daughter,
the Archduchess Margaret, to marry him; but he
would go and see her in order to persuade her.'
Whilst these negotiations were taking place, an unexpected
event freed Margaret from this distasteful
marriage, though it added another sorrow to her lot.</p>

<p>In September of the same year her brother Philip
was attacked by a malignant fever at Burgos,
brought on, it was said, by indulgence or over-exercise,
and for days lay ill in raging delirium, not
without strong suspicions of poison. He was assiduously
attended by his wife Joanna, who never left
his side, but in spite of all her care the disorder
rapidly gained ground, and on the sixth day after
his attack, on September 25th, he breathed his last.
Philip was only twenty-eight years old, and had
been King of Castile two months, dating from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
recognition by the Cortes. After his death Queen
Joanna still stayed by his side, deaf to all condolence
or remonstrance, to all appearance unmoved. She
calmly gave orders that her husband's body should
be carried in state to the great hall of the Constable's
palace upon a splendid catafalque of cloth of gold,
the body clad in ermine-lined robes of rich brocade,
the head covered by a jewelled cap, and a magnificent
diamond cross upon the breast. A throne had been
erected at the end of the hall, and upon this the
corpse was arranged, seated as if in life. During the
whole of the night the vigils for the dead were intoned
by friars before the throne, and when the sunlight
crept through the windows the body, stripped
of its incongruous finery, was opened and embalmed
and placed in a lead coffin, from which, for the rest
of her life, Joanna never willingly parted.'<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<a href="images/illus109_b.jpg">View larger image</a></p>

<p>Philip left six children&mdash;Eleanor, Charles (afterwards
the Emperor Charles <span class="smcap">V</span>.), Isabella, Ferdinand,
Mary, and a little daughter, Katharine, born five
months after his death. Philip was of middle
height, and had a fair, florid complexion, regular
features, long flowing locks, and a well-made figure.
He was so distinguished for his good looks that he is
designated on the roll of Spanish sovereigns as <i>Felipe
el Hermoso</i>, or the Handsome. His mental endowments
were not so extraordinary. The father of
Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> possessed scarcely a single quality in
common with his remarkable son. His poor wife
Joanna never recovered his loss, her mind became
more and more affected, and though she survived
him for nearly half a century, she dragged out her
cheerless existence a sort of state-prisoner in the
palace of Tordesillas, a queen only in name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Margaret herself composed her brother's Latin
epitaph, which ended with a cry of anguish from
the Lamentations of Jeremiah:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i3">Ecce iterum novus dolor accidit!</p>
<p class="i1">Nec satis erat infortunissimæ Cæsaris filiæ</p>
<p class="i3">Conjugem amisisse dilectissimum,</p>
<p class="i5">Nisi etiam fratrem unicum</p>
<p class="i5">Mors aspera subriperet!</p>

<p>'Attendite et videte si est dolor sicut dolor meus!'<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>Erasmus also dedicated a Latin eulogy to the archduke,
and Jean le Maire, who had been attached to
his person, addressed some verses to Margaret entitled:
'<i>Les regrets de la dame infortunée sur le
trespas de son très chier frère unicque.</i>' She also
received a sympathetic letter of condolence from
Louis <span class="smcap">XII</span>. Her reply, written from Bourg where
she was staying, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">'Monseigneur, très-humblement à vostre bonne
grace me recommande; Monseigneur, j'ay par vostre
président Villeneufve receu voz bonnes et gracieuses

le Roy de France.'</p>

<hr class="c5" />

<p>But although her brother was dead, Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>
had not given up all hope of winning the reluctant
Margaret for his bride. On October 1st he wrote to
her father that 'he has been informed that Madame
Margaret makes great difficulties about ratifying the
treaty of marriage'; and then threatens 'it would
not be a thing to be wondered if he were to accept
one of the great and honourable matches which are
daily offered to him on all sides.' On October 31st we
read that 'the French ambassadors are on their way
to England, in order to offer to the King the
daughter of the Duke of Angoulême in marriage.
But the King of England has decided not to accept
the proposal, as he still hopes to obtain the hand of
the Duchess Margaret.' However, his hopes were
vain, and Margaret was stern in her refusal. Henry
next proposed to marry Joanna, the widowed Queen
of Castile, but this iniquitous plan too was thwarted,
and he remained a widower to the end of his life.
Philip's death imposed new cares and duties upon
Margaret; his children were left minors, and upon
them she lavished the wealth of affection which fate
had denied her giving to her own offspring. Her
nephew Charles was her especial care, and he could
hardly have entered political life under better tutelage,
though his aunt's masterful nature may have
checked the development of his own individuality.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>REGENT OF THE NETHERLANDS</h3>

<p class="p2">By King Philip's death the Netherlands were
left without a ruler, for his eldest son
Charles was barely six years old. A few
weeks later, at eight o'clock on the morning of the
18th of October 1506, the deputies from the provinces
assembled at Malines in the Salle de la Cour
to discuss the desirability of appointing a regent for
the Netherlands, and a governor for King Philip's
children. The fair-haired child the Archduke Charles
was present with the members of his family, his
Council, and the Knights of the Order of the Golden
Fleece, all clothed in the deepest mourning. After
a long preamble, in which he recounted the chief
events in Philip's last voyage to Spain, the Chancellor
of Burgundy proposed that the deputies should
choose a regent and provide for the tutelage of the
late king's children.</p>

<p>The representatives from Brabant, Holland, Zealand,
and Friesland voted for the emperor; those
from Flanders, Artois, Lille, Douai, and Orchiés
said they were without instructions; but the deputies
from Hainault and Namur refused to express an
opinion, fearing to annoy the King of France, whose
troops were already threatening their frontiers. The
choice was therefore left to the States of Brabant,
who immediately sent their ambassadors to Ems to
offer the regency to Maximilian. Pleased with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
deference the States had shown him, he accepted
their offer; but, under pretext of the burden of state
affairs arising from the management of his kingdom,
he deputed his daughter Margaret to bring up and
educate Philip's children, under his direction, and
appointed her regent of her nephew's dominions
until he should come of age.</p>

<p>At Maximilian's invitation the States-General of
the Netherlands met at Louvain in March 1507 to
arrange for Margaret's installation. The Duke of
Juliers, in the name of the emperor, administered
the oath of '<i>mambour</i>,' or governess; Margaret was
then recognised as Governess-General and Guardian
of Philip's children.</p>

<p>'Maximilian,' says Garnier, 'could not have chosen
a more able and intelligent minister; she was also the
most dangerous and active enemy that France could
have.' The emperor, who was the most fickle of men,
was only constant in his hatred of France. In order
to feed this inborn aversion, he often re-read what he
called his red book. This book was a register in
which he noted carefully all the slights that France
had made him and his country suffer, in order, he said,
to pay her (France) off at his leisure; and in August
of the same year (1507) he made a furious speech at
the Diet of Constance, in which he called Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>
an ambitious traitor, a perjurer, and a disturber of
Christianity.</p>

<p>Margaret chose Malines for her residence, and
here for many years she held her Court. As the
principal home of the Regent of the Netherlands,
Malines, already a flourishing city, gained much in
riches and importance. Its motto, <i>In fide constans</i>,
had been given to the town in recognition of the
courage and fidelity of its inhabitants, who had often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
proved their loyalty to the House of Burgundy. This
fact may have influenced Margaret's choice of Malines
as her principal residence, but it had also been the
home of her godmother, Margaret of York, sister of
Edward <span class="smcap">IV.</span> of England, the last Duchess of Burgundy,
known as 'Madame la Grande,' who had been a second
mother to her in her early youth, before she left
her home for Amboise. Margaret of York had died
at Malines in 1505. Her husband had settled the
town and seigniory upon her as dowry, and besides
an income of sixteen thousand florins or 'Philippus
d'or,' she also owned the palace called La Cour de
Cambray, which she had bought, as the Court possessed
no residence at Malines, and left it in her will
to Philip and his sister. Margaret lived in this palace,
which was later known as the 'Cour de l'Empereur,'
with her nephew Charles and his three sisters, Eleanor,
Isabella, and Mary. Her youngest nephew, Ferdinand,
had remained in Spain with his grandfather,
the King of Aragon, who educated him, and whose
favourite he became. Philip's youngest daughter,
Katharine, born after his death, shared her mother's
captivity in the old palace of Tordesillas, until her
marriage seventeen years later.</p>

<p>Finding that the palace at Malines was not large
enough for all her requirements, Margaret persuaded
Maximilian to buy another house exactly opposite
belonging to Jérôme Lauwrin, which he presented to
her after redecorating and altering it to suit her
requirements. On July 6th, 1507, she made her
solemn entry into the town and installed herself in
the palace with her nephew and nieces.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Jehan le Maire gives an interesting account of a
memorial service in memory of Philip, King of Castile,
held at Malines a few days later in the church of
Saint Rombault on Sunday the 18th of July 1507.
This record of an eye-witness is addressed to the
'très illustre et très claire princesse, Madame Marguerite
d'Autriche.'<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In his description of the gorgeous procession, headed
by the late king's officers and servants, which slowly
wound its way through the streets of Malines to the
cathedral church of Saint Rombault, Le Maire
enumerates the motley crowd of priests and chaplains,
begging friars, lawyers, and deputies from the states
in their robes of office, the processions from various
churches, and all the guilds of Malines in their state
costume, carrying countless crosses and banners,
followed by a crowd of humbler citizens bearing flaring
torches. The procession of ambassadors, bishops,
and nobles with their arms and devices; each contingent
led by heralds on richly caparisoned chargers
carrying the arms and banners of Hapsburg and
Burgundy, with the banners of King Philip's ancestors,
those of the Emperor Frederick, Charles
the Bold, Isabel of Bourbon, and Mary of Burgundy
being minutely described. In the midst of his
chronicle Le Maire suddenly addresses Margaret:&mdash;
'You, gracious lady and princess, were also present,
secretly praying in your oratory for the soul of your
only brother, whom may God absolve, very simply
dressed in your mourning, and covered by a veil, in
company with your noble ladies.'</p>

<p>In the cathedral, the young Archduke Charles sat
facing the pulpit, whilst the late king's confessor,
John, Bishop of Salubri, preached the funeral oration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
dwelling at much length on King Philip's virtues
and great gifts. Le Maire relates that the large
congregation was so touched by his eloquence that
many were melted to tears, and he adds: 'I believe,
very gracious Madame, ... that you too were
secretly weeping in your oratory.'</p>

<p>At the end of high mass, when the Bishop of Arras
pronounced the words, 'Et verbum caro factum est,'
the heralds cast down their banners on the marble
floor before the high altar, and the king-at-arms of
the Golden Fleece threw his staff of office on the
ground and cried three times, 'The king is dead.'
After a pause he picked it up, and raising it above
his head, proclaimed: 'Long live Don Charles, by the
grace of God Archduke of Austria and Prince of
Spain.' ... Then the first herald raised his banner,
and waving it on high, cried, 'Of Burgundy, of Lostrick,
and of Brabant.' And the second herald took
up the cry, as he lifted his banner, proclaiming Charles
'Count of Flanders, Artois, Burgundy, Palatine of
Hainault, Holland, Zealand, Namur, and Zutphen.'
Then the third and fourth heralds raised their banners
and continued the stately roll-call, ending with 'Marquis
of the Holy Empire, Lord of Friesland, of Salins
and Malines!'</p>

<p>The cap of mourning which had been worn by the
young prince was now removed from his head by the
king-at-arms, who took the great sword, which had
been blessed by the bishop, from the altar, and held
it in front of the Archduke Charles, thus addressing
him: 'Prince Imperial and royal, this sword of justice
is given to you from God ... and from your noble
ancestors ... that you may protect the most Holy
Faith and all your kingdoms....'</p>

<p>The king-at-arms then kissed the sword and gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
it into the young archduke's hands, who took it by
the hilt, and, with the point in the air, advanced and
knelt before the high altar.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, writing on October 18th, 1506, to condole
with Maximilian on the death of his son, promised
to remain his good friend and the friend of the
Prince of Castile, and to assist them in everything.
If King Philip had lived, he says, the treaties which
he had concluded with him would have been carried
out. Maximilian replied that he 'hopes Henry will
not forsake the poor orphan, who is Maximilian's son
as well as Henry's.'</p>

<p>The few years of Philip's government had been
relatively peaceful, but at his death troubles broke
out anew. It is difficult to draw a line between the
Dutch and Flemings, yet the Dutch provinces were,
as a whole, distinct in character and interests from the
Flemish; and much more deeply were the commercial
and manufacturing Flemish provinces divided from the
French-speaking states of Artois, Hainault, West
Flanders, Luxembourg, and Franche Comté. The
latter were held under the empire, and the youthful
Charles, as Count of Flanders, was also a peer of
France. The princely diocese of Liége, French in
language and sympathy, but politically connected
with the empire, was only separated from the Flemish
group by the Burgundian lordship of Namur, Limburg,
and Luxembourg. Lorraine stood between
Franche Comté and the Netherlands, Franche Comté
having a far closer connection with the Swiss than
with the Netherlands, whilst the fortunes of Limburg
and Luxembourg were destined to be quite distinct
from those of the Dutch and Flemish provinces. It
was to be the task of the future ruler to revive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
monarchical institutions and to create a national unity
among alien races and interests. At Philip's death
Charles succeeded to a wasted heritage. All the
chief factories and industries peculiar to the Netherlands
had dwindled and diminished, and even the
fishing fleet of former days had shrunk to only a few
sail in some of the ports of the Zuyder Zee.</p>

<p>During the early years of Charles's life we only
get a few glimpses of a shy and inarticulate boy. We
read of him dancing round a bonfire with his sisters
on Saint John's Day. His grandfather, Maximilian,
gave him a wooden horse, and amongst his prized
possessions was a sledge in the form of a ship, with
masts, ropes, and flags. In games, like most children,
he liked to be on the winning side. When he and
his page played at battles between Turks and
Christians, Charles was always a Christian, and the
page, who commanded the paynim host, complained
that the Christians were always made to win. The
boy was brought up to like manly sports. He shot
skilfully with the bow, and took great delight in
hunting, which pleased the old Emperor Maximilian,
for otherwise, he wrote, the boy could not be his
legitimate grandson. Charles as a child is described
as graceful and well-built, but his face was pale, and
he looked delicate. His long projecting lower jaw,
so peculiar to the Hapsburg family, embarrassed
mastication and caused hesitation in his speech. He
had clear and steady eyes, and a calm, intellectual
forehead which gave a pleasant and dignified expression
to his face. His childhood was spent at Malines,
and there watched over by his aunt Margaret he was
brought up in the strict etiquette of the Burgundian
Court.</p>

<p>Charles was devoted to music, a taste which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
cultivated throughout his life. As a boy we hear of
him and his sister Eleanor having lessons on the
clavicord and other instruments from the organist of
the chapel. He was carefully educated. His grandfather
appointed William de Croy, Lord of Chièvre,
as his governor, and he was taught to read and write
by Juan de Verd, who in 1505 was succeeded by another
Spaniard, Luis Vaca, who after six years gave
up his charge to Adrian of Utrecht, Dean of Louvain,
the future Pope Adrian <span class="smcap">IV</span>. But the boy was not a
willing pupil; he complained of being educated as if
he were intended for a schoolmaster. The future ruler
of so many vast kingdoms was never a good linguist.
He learned very little Latin, and was never proficient
in German. Two years after he became King of
Castile and Aragon he only knew a few words of the
national language. His knowledge of Italian was
barely elementary. Flemish was the tongue of his
birthplace, but he did not begin to learn it until he
was thirteen. French was his natural language, but
he neither spoke nor wrote it with any elegance. Of
theology the champion of Catholicism knew little or
nothing. He could scarcely read the Vulgate, and in
his latter years his comprehension thereof had to be
aided by very simple commentary. Mathematics he
studied when over thirty, as he believed they were
essential to the career of a great captain.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>At the time of Margaret's appointment as Governess
of the Netherlands she was twenty-seven years
old. She is described as a 'fair young woman with
golden hair, rounded cheeks, a grave mouth, and
beautiful clear eyes.' And when she reappeared in
Flanders, with the added charm born of her many
sorrows, she was received with unanimous joy by all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the people, with whom she was extremely popular.
Amongst other poems written at this time in her
honour the following was composed by Jean Molinet,
her librarian and almoner:&mdash;</p>

Marguerite d'Autriche.</p>

<p>Margaret was lucky in her councillors. She was
seconded by such clever and devoted ministers as
Burgo, Mélun, Viry, Le Vaux, Caulies, Mercurin de
Gattinare, Ferry de Carondelet, and Albert Pio. One
of the ablest amongst them was Mercurin de Gattinare,
who came of a noble family of Verceil, and
was one of the greatest jurisconsuls of his time. He
had been a councillor of the late Duke of Savoy's, and
afterwards president of the Parliament of Franche
Comté. In 1508 Maximilian sent him to Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>'s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Court to negotiate on the subject of the Treaty of
Cambray.</p>

<p>On February 3rd, 1507, Margaret wrote from
Malines to James d'Albion, King Ferdinand's ambassador
in France, that 'she was very sorry that
the peace between the King of France and the King
of the Romans was not concluded. If the King of
France should attack the estates of Prince Charles,'
she says, 'she would do her best to defend them, and
she hopes that the King of England and King
Ferdinand would assist her. She begs that this
may be communicated to King Ferdinand.'</p>

<p>Margaret was no sooner invested with the government
of the Netherlands than, accompanied by her
young nephew, she visited all the towns of Flanders,
and promised in the prince's name to preserve the
rights and privileges of the seventeen provinces,
whose homage and oath of fidelity she received.
Mercurin de Gattinare paid homage to Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> in
her name for the county of Charollais and the
Burgundian territories. The letter in which he tells
Margaret of the accomplishment of his mission
contains this curious passage: 'J'ai fait vostre
hommage entre les mains du roi, et l'ai baisé en
vostre lieu, et me répliqua encore de nouveau qu'il
eût mieux aimé vous baiser que moi.'</p>

<p>On July 20th, 1507, Margaret convoked the States-General
at Malines, and asked them to levy a
'philippus' on each household. This tax was to be
employed in paying the army in Gueldres, and in
redeeming the prince's mortgaged lands. The States
did not welcome this proposal, but voted a subsidy
of 200,000 philippus. Charles, who was now seven
years old, made his first public speech before the
States at Louvain, where Margaret had cleverly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
brought him to support her claim for the subsidy.
Its purport was understood rather from his gestures
than the sounding quality of the boyish voice; but
at all events, the chronicler adds, the people could
not fail to be well pleased. Reassembled at Ghent,
the States refused to support the cost of an
army of 10,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry, which
Margaret judged necessary to guard the country
during the prince's minority. They objected that
in the present circumstances this levy seemed to
them useless; but if the country was really threatened
it should be attended to; yet at that very moment
Holland and Brabant were attacked by the Duke
of Gueldres, aided and abetted by the King of
France.</p>

<p>The States' refusal to grant proper subsidies greatly
irritated Maximilian. In a remarkable letter he tried
to show them that the war with Gueldres was
not only of interest to Brabant, as they pretended,
but to all the Netherlands, and that all ought to
take part in it. He recalls how the princes of the
House of Burgundy had laboured from the days of
Charles the Bold to reduce the duchy of Gueldres,
and the efforts of the French kings to defraud them
of their legitimate rights. He complains above all of
Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>, who had employed every imaginable means
to leave the contested country to Charles of Egmont.
'And what is his real aim?' he asks. 'He pretends
through the medium of the said country of Gueldres
to separate our country from the Holy Empire, and
from the House of Burgundy, so as to better hold
this country in subjection.'</p>

<p>On September 16th Maximilian wrote to Margaret
to acknowledge her letters in which she requested
him to come to Flanders in order to conclude a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
alliance with England. He has, he says, been prevented
from doing so, but begs that King Henry
may be amused with false hopes, and kept from
concluding an alliance with France and Spain. 'If
she would consent to marry the King of England, it
might be arranged that she should remain Governess
of the Netherlands, and pass three or four months
every year in her own country.'</p>

<p>A few days later De Puebla, writing from England
to King Ferdinand, informs him that ambassadors
have arrived at the English Court from Maximilian
and from Flanders, the former to beg King Henry
to make war against France, alleging that the French
king was usurping his grandson's (Prince Charles's)
dominions. The ambassador also broached the subject
of the prince's marriage with Princess Mary,
King Henry's daughter. The Flemish ambassador,
Don Diego de Gueyara, told the king that King
Louis had declared war against all the seigniories of
Burgundy, and invaded them with an army, excepting
Flanders and Artois, which two provinces
recognised the sovereignty of France, and the appeals
from their tribunals went direct to the Parliament of
Paris. The ambassador begged for King Henry's
help against France and the Duke of Gueldres. The
English king promised to ask the French monarch
not to meddle in German affairs, but at the same
time he wished to keep friends with France, and so
put off the ambassadors with polite and general
phrases which meant nothing. De Puebla adds in a
postscript: 'The King of England sends six horses
and some greyhounds to the Archduchess Margaret,
and a letter.'</p>

<p>A few weeks later De Puebla tells King Ferdinand
that Margaret had sent a very loving letter to King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Henry the previous week, holding out hopes that her
father would send a 'great personage' as ambassador
to England with full powers to conclude all the
treaties which her brother Philip had arranged, and
if necessary to grant more favourable conditions.
De Puebla states that when he asked King Henry
what the treaties were about, the king replied 'they
were very good treaties, and very advantageous to
himself personally, and also to his kingdom, for,
besides his own marriage with the Archduchess
Margaret, an alliance had been concluded between
the Archduke Charles and his daughter, Princess
Mary, and all matters respecting commerce settled
according to his wishes.' De Puebla wound up his
letter by informing Ferdinand that King Henry was
anxious to keep friends with the Emperor Maximilian,
and not to break off negotiations with him, at any
rate not without first consulting the King of
Aragon.</p>

<p>On December 4th Maximilian wrote to Margaret
acknowledging her letters and the articles concluded
between the Flemish and English ambassadors. He
told her that the French king had complained to the
Pope, King Ferdinand, and even to the Diet of
Constance, that he (Maximilian) had broken his word
in marrying Prince Charles to Princess Mary. In
order to satisfy his honour the emperor requests that
a clause should be inserted in the marriage treaty to
the effect that the whole treaty should be null and
void, and not even the penalty paid if the King of
France declare himself ready, within one year, to
marry his daughter Claude to Prince Charles. On
the 21st of December 1507 two treaties were drawn
up and dated Calais. One, a treaty of alliance between
Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, Maximilian and Prince Charles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
was practically the same as the former treaty concluded
between Henry and the Archduke Philip;
and the other, concerning the marriage of the Archduke
Charles with the Princess Mary, was between
Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, Maximilian, the Archduke Charles and
the Archduchess Margaret, but was unsigned. In
this treaty the Archduke Charles is to conclude the
marriage with the Princess Mary, either in person or
by proxy, before the following Easter. He is to
contract the marriage by ambassadors sent to England
for the purpose within forty days after he has
completed his fourteenth year. The King of England
is to send Princess Mary to the Archduke Charles
within three months after the marriage shall have
been contracted <i>per verba de præsenti</i>. The dowry to
consist of 250,000 crowns. The Emperor Maximilian,
the Archduchess Margaret, Charles de Croy, Henry,
Count of Nassau, bind themselves to pay 250,000
crowns to King Henry if the Archduke refuses to
contract the marriage. The King of England and
his nobles bind themselves to pay an equal sum to
Maximilian if Princess Mary refuses to fulfil the
agreement. The treaty to be ratified by the
contracting parties before the following Feast of
Easter.</p>

<p>An interesting account exists of an interview between
King Henry's ambassador and the Emperor
Maximilian. In it we learn that the emperor had
long conferences with his daughter respecting her
marriage with King Henry, which had been settled
by her brother Philip. In order to persuade Margaret,
Maximilian told her that the marriage was
necessary for the good of the House of Austria,
besides being honourable to her, the King of England
being 'such a pattern of all the virtues.' He added
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
that it was also necessary on account of commerce,
and in order to secure the Spanish succession, and
keep the Duke of Gueldres at bay; without it the
King of England might marry into another family
and endanger the marriage between Prince Charles
and Princess Mary. The emperor told the English
ambassador that the Archduchess was fully aware of
King Henry's many virtues, and that should she
marry again, she would marry no one else but him.
But as she has already been three times unfortunate
in her marriages, she is much disinclined to make
another trial. Besides, she said she believed she
should have no children, and that she might thereby
displease the King of England. Seeing that he
could not prevail on Margaret to change her mind,
her father called the Privy Council together, his
grandson Charles being present. The question of
the marriage was once more discussed, but the Archduchess
remained firm in her decision. The ambassador
remarks: 'From all this it is clear that the
emperor has done all in his power to persuade his
daughter to consent to the marriage, and that he
can do nothing more.' But in spite of Margaret's
absolute refusal to marry Henry, his agents for
more than a year pressed her to reconsider her
decision. The utmost that could be obtained was to
prevail on her to write, from time to time, flattering
letters to him in order to secure some advantages
for her father.</p>

<p>On January 28th, 1508, Maximilian wrote to
Margaret from Bolzano to tell her that 'he is
sending Andreas de Burgo to England, and that
he has ordered him to see her before he starts.
Andreas has some money, but it may not be enough
to defray his expenses; he has therefore given him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
directions to take some money for his own use from
the 100,000 gold crowns which the King of England
is expected to give.' He also begs her to write a
pleasant letter to King Henry.</p>

<p>A few weeks later Maximilian again wrote to
Margaret excusing himself for not having sent the
ratifications of the treaties with England. He has
been so much occupied, he says, with his great
undertakings in Italy and Spain, that he has really
had no time to attend to that business; but he has
now done so.</p>

<p>In May of the same year Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> wrote a
letter to Sir John Wiltshire, Comptroller of Calais,
about a correspondence with Margaret, in which
King Henry tried to persuade her to arrange a
meeting with him at Calais to treat with him in
person about her nephew's marriage with Princess
Mary. He suggests that some 'discreet and able
personages' should be sent on before to 'reduce the
said matters to a final and perfect conclusion' before
he and Margaret met, so that when they did meet
they could talk of 'other pleasant and comfortable
matters,' and all business could be concluded before
their meeting. But Margaret does not seem to have
accepted this invitation, and the meeting so much
desired by King Henry did not take place.</p>

<p>On July 23rd Maximilian wrote to tell her that he
has received her letters, in which she begs him to
alter the instructions given to his ambassadors who
are starting for England. He says he cannot do so,
as she knows that the principal reason which has
induced him to betroth Prince Charles to Princess
Mary is to get a good sum of money from the King
of England. King Henry has promised 100,000
crowns, but has requested that in the security to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
given by the towns of Flanders, each town should be
responsible for the whole sum. But the utmost that
the towns can be induced to do is that each town
would be responsible for a certain portion. If the
King of England is not content with this proposal, it
will show that he loves money more than his friend,
and the marriage of his daughter with Prince Charles
shall not take place. But Maximilian adds, 'should
the Flemish towns after all be willing to sign the
bonds in the manner the King of England wishes,
he will not object.'</p>

<p>Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, who had been ailing for some time,
now fell seriously ill, and his illness appears to have
been the cause of the postponement of Prince
Charles's marriage with Princess Mary, which was
to have been solemnised before the Feast of Easter.
Johannes de Berghes was deputed to go to England
and perform the ceremony according to the rites of
the Church, in the name of the Archduke.</p>

<p>'On the 7th of October 1508 Charles was indeed
wedded by proxy to the English princess, and at the
age of eight wrote or rather signed his first love-letter,
addressed to little Princess Mary Tudor, to
whom he presented a jewel bearing the monogram K.,
and the posy, <i>Maria optimam partem elegit, quae non
auferetur ab ea</i>.</p>

<p>'This was the last of Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>'s many diplomatic
triumphs; and it was no nominal momentary union,
but was confirmed in 1513, and the boy-bridegroom
then visited his brother-in-law Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> in his
newly-won city of Tournay, his first royal visit.
The following year the future King of Spain and
Queen of France were parted in the shuffling of the
cards, and although Mary Tudor married the old
French king, statesmen on both sides regretted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
more natural alliance. Before six years more had
passed Charles was pledged to his betrothed's younger
namesake, and thirty-four years later he showed all
a young lover's eagerness in courting this second
Mary Tudor for his son Philip.'<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE LEAGUE OF CAMBRAY</h3>

<p class="p2">Though Margaret's time was now fully
occupied by her new duties, she did not
forget the work she had begun at Brou.
Early in 1508, immediately after her arrival in
Brussels, she made a will, designating the church of
the monastery of Saint Nicolas de Tolentin at Brou,
near Bourg-en-Bresse, as her place of sepulture,
where she wished to be buried near 'her very dear
lord and husband.' 'The Duke Philibert of Savoy
to lie between her and his mother, Madame de
Bourbon.'</p>

<p>By an endowment she ensured the building of the
monastery and the church of Brou, and the erection
of the three tombs. Solemn religious services
were to be performed there during each season, and
only on certain days the people and magistrates were
to be allowed to enter the sanctuary to offer up their
prayers with those of the priests and monks. She
also made gifts to the church of Notre-Dame de
Bourg, and to several religious houses in the town,
on condition that they should hold certain services;
and she left legacies to the hospital, infirmary,
and plague-house, and dowered fifty marriageable
maidens of Bresse and fifty of Burgundy. Lastly,
she ordained the ceremony of bringing her body to
Bresse and the details of her funeral. All these
provisions she made, lest death should take her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
unawares and stop the work she had so much at
heart. This interesting will, expressing as it does
Margaret's most intimate thoughts, also throws great
light on the customs and practices of the time. The
document is dated March 4th, 1508, and confirmed
by a codicil twenty-two years later, in 1530.</p>

<p>From the year 1508 Margaret's life is no longer a
private one. The part she took in politics from the
date of her investiture as Governess of the Netherlands
until her death belongs to European history.
By her talents, ability, and rare aptitude for business
she eclipsed more powerful rulers, and soon became
the pivot of political life in Europe.</p>

<p>Strong as she was in the qualities her father
lacked, she yet knew how to defer to his wishes,
whilst holding strongly to her own opinions, and
was always an affectionate and dutiful daughter.
Maximilian's radical inconstancy and indecision of
temper led him into many troubles, and his extravagance
involved him in perpetual pecuniary difficulties,
which destroyed all dignity of character; but he
seems to have had the greatest admiration and
respect for his clever daughter, to whose wise judgment
he constantly deferred, as his many letters
to her testify.</p>

<p>The warlike Pontiff, Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span>, had announced his
intention of 'driving the barbarians out of Italy by
force of arms.' He it was who first instigated the
League which was to prove so disastrous to France,
and was to be the cause of so many years of bloodshed
in Italy.</p>

<p>Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span> had been favourably impressed by
Margaret's exemplary piety, and the respect and
deference she had shown towards the Holy See.
On several occasions he willingly granted her requests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
and also sent her many relics and objects of
devotion, amongst others two thorns from the true
Cross, which, until the eighteenth century, were still
preserved at Brou.</p>

<p>The League so desired by the Pope, known to
history as the League of Cambray, was soon brought
into discussion between the great powers of Europe.
Two subjects were to be negotiated at the conference:
the one consisted in the reconciliation of
the Duke of Gueldres with the government of the
Archduke Charles, and the other, which was to be
kept secret, was the formation of a league against
the Venetians. The princes who were to take part
in it were the Pope, the King of France, the Emperor
Maximilian, and Ferdinand, King of Aragon.
Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> of England, whose daughter Mary was
betrothed to the Archduke Charles, had a direct
interest in the Congress, as the Archduke's affairs
were, ostensibly at least, the principal subject of the
deliberations, but he does not seem to have been
invited to join it. He begged the Archduchess
Margaret, through Edmund Wingfield, to combine
with the Cardinal of Amboise, in order that Ferdinand
might be excluded from the negotiations and
from the intended treaty; but the result was such
as might have been anticipated&mdash;Henry did not
exclude Ferdinand from the League, but Ferdinand
excluded Henry from all advantage in it. This
exclusion was so complete that, whilst the King of
Hungary, the Duke of Milan, the Dukes of Savoy
and Ferrara, and even the Marquis of Mantua were
invited to join it, Henry's name was not even
mentioned, though, as an afterthought, his ambassador
was allowed to be present at the meetings.
Moreover, the emperor and Ferdinand, who until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
now had been at variance, were reconciled, and postponed
their differences concerning the regency of
Spain until the war against Venice should be concluded.</p>

<p>On October the 8th Maximilian wrote to Margaret
from Schoenhoven in answer to a letter of hers asking
for his permission for the Papal Legate to confer the
rite of confirmation on the Archduke Charles and his
sisters.</p>

<p>'Very dear and much-loved daughter,&mdash;We have
received your letters in which you tell us that you
think it well that the Legate should, before his
departure, confer the holy Sacrament of Confirmation
upon our dear and much-loved grandchildren, and
that he has agreed with you to do so; but because
our dearly loved grandson Charles is at Lyère, you
do not know which we prefer, whether our said
grandson should be brought to our granddaughters
at Malines, or our granddaughters to him. In consulting
our wishes in everything you give us much
pleasure. Wherefore, very dear and much-loved
daughter, we inform you that we are content that
our said grandson travel to Malines to receive the
said holy Sacrament and the benediction of the said
Legate, in our name and his. And for this reason
we are now writing to our very dear and loyal cousin
the Prince of Chimay to take him there. Until then,
much-beloved daughter, may our Lord have you in
His holy keeping.'<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>On the 27th of October Maximilian again wrote
to Margaret informing her that 'he has heard that
she is preparing to go to the Congress of Cambray.
As he is told that a great number of strangers are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
expected, he advises her to engage all the houses on
one side of the town, and to leave the other half to
the Cardinal of Amboise. She must,' he says, 'take
the English ambassadors to Cambray, especially
Wingfield, and admit them to the deliberations. If
an ambassador from the King of Aragon come, she
is to ask him whether he is provided with authority
from the king, and if he is, to admit him.'</p>

<p>He tells her that 'his ambassadors have not yet
gone to England, because he has not had time to
furnish them with instructions. He has now ordered
them to set out immediately, and will send the
instructions after them.' Breda, 27th October 1508.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In November 1508 Edward Wingfield wrote to
Margaret to inform her that 'Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> has it
much at heart that the affairs of the Emperor and
the Prince, his son (Prince Charles, his grandson),
should be settled to the greatest advantage in the
approaching Congress of Cambray, and that their
enemies should be entirely discomfited. As long as
the alliance between the King of France and the
King of Aragon continues, he says, it is to be feared
that the principal enemy of the Emperor and Prince
Charles will triumph. For if he be assisted by
France, the King of Aragon will most probably be
able, not only to keep the usurped government of
Castile in his own hands, and the other dominions
belonging to that kingdom, as long as he lives, but
also to deprive the Prince of his right of succession.
To prevent this, it seems to Henry that the best
plan would be to exclude the King of Aragon from
the treaties that are to be made at Cambray, and to
sever the alliance existing between him and the King
of France. The King of Aragon has usurped the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
government of Castile only by means of the help of
the King of France. If he were to be isolated, he
would be unable to preserve it, and the Emperor
would have it in his power, aided by those who are
inimical to the King of Aragon, to take the government
of that kingdom into his own hands....'<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Margaret also kept ostensibly on the most friendly
terms with Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>, whose correspondence with her
about this time shows that to him at least she concealed
her hatred of France. In each of his letters
he takes a pleasure in reminding her of their early
friendship and of their childish games, in the days
when she was 'la petite Reine' at Amboise.</p>

<p>It is evident that being on such excellent terms
with the chief sovereigns in Europe gave Margaret
some advantage where negotiations and treaties were
concerned. In fact she intervened as arbitrator or
negotiator in most of the political events of this time.
Her experience and knowledge of different countries
made her old for her years. 'Madame Margaret,'
says Jean le Maire, 'has seen and experienced more
at her youthful age ... than any lady on record,
however long her life.'</p>

<p>It is, therefore, not surprising that Margaret was
deputed by Maximilian and Ferdinand to act as
their representative at the forthcoming Congress.
Hostilities had continued more actively than ever
between the Duke of Gueldres and the provinces
of the Netherlands. At last a truce of forty days
was declared during which time Margaret went to
Cambray to meet the Cardinal of Amboise, and to
confer with him with a view to concluding a final
peace. She arrived at Cambray in November 1508
with an escort of a hundred horsemen and a company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of archers. Half the town was reserved for her
and her suite; the other half had been placed at
the disposal of the Cardinal of Amboise, who was
acting on behalf of the Pope and Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>, and
was accompanied by Étienne de Poncher, Bishop of
Paris, and Alberto Pio, Count of Carpi.</p>

<p>Margaret, invested with full powers by Maximilian,
was escorted by Mathieu Lang, Bishop of Gurk, the
emperor's confidant and secretary; Mercurin de
Gattinare, President of the Burgundian Parliament;
Jean Peters, President of the Council of Malines;
Jean Gooselet, Abbot of Maroilles; and Jean Caulier,
President of the Privy Council. She was also instructed
to admit Jacques de Croy, Bishop of
Cambray, and Edmund Wingfield, the English ambassador,
to the negotiations, as well as King
Ferdinand's envoy, if he should send one.</p>

<p>The Sieur de Chièvres (de Croy) and other
members of the Burgundian Council accompanied
the princess as far as Valenciennes, and remained
there to receive daily reports of the proceedings at
Cambray, and to give their help if necessary.
Maximilian stayed at Malines to transact the business
of the Netherlands during his daughter's absence.
Du Bos, speaking of the part that Margaret played
in the League of Cambray, says: 'This princess had
a man's talent for managing business, in fact she was
more capable than most men, for she added to her
talents the fascination of her sex; brought up as
she had been to hide her own feelings, conciliate her
opponents, and persuade all parties that she was
acting blindly in their interests.'</p>

<p>Another contemporary writer says: 'This princess
received the Cardinal with great honour, captivated
him by her courteous, insinuating, and caressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
manners, and was so successful in charming him, that
he could refuse her nothing.'</p>

<p>Margaret and the Cardinal began by fixing the
laws of the dependence of the principal provinces of
the Netherlands with regard to France. Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>
did not wish to cede what he called the rights of his
crown, and Margaret would not yield any of the
prerogatives obtained by the last Dukes of Burgundy.
She and the Cardinal had many hot disputes, and
several times were on the point of separating.
Margaret argued until she often had a headache, and
we are told they 'cuydoient se prendre au poil.'
Finally they agreed to leave the most difficult questions
until the archduke should come of age. It was
decided that Charles Egmont should have (provisionally)
the duchy of Gueldres and the county of
Zutphen, but that he should restore three or four
places which he had taken in Holland to Charles,
who, on his part, should give up certain castles which
he still held in the duchy of Gueldres; that things
should remain thus until the respective commissioners
nominated by the Emperor Maximilian and the King
of England on one side, and by the Kings of France
and Scotland on the other, had examined the rights
of both sides and given their decision.</p>

<p>With regard to the second part of this treaty,
which was to be kept secret until it was executed, no
difficulty was raised. It was to share the spoils of
the Venetians, and this sharing was done in advance.</p>

<p>Maximilian and Ferdinand agreed to postpone
their differences concerning the regency of Castile
until this division was successfully accomplished. At
last, on December the 10th, 1508, the League of Cambray
was signed by Margaret of Austria and the
Cardinal of Amboise, 'pour faire cesser les dommages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
injures, rapines, et maux que les Vénitiens ont faits
tant au Saint-Siège apostolique qu'au Saint Empire
Romain, à la Maison d'Autriche, aux Ducs de Milan,
aux Rois de Naples, etc.' Immediately after the
treaty was signed, Margaret, the Cardinal, and King
Ferdinand's ambassador took a solemn oath in the
cathedral of Cambray to observe the treaty which
they had just concluded. 'This League was the
result of a new political system which was beginning
to prevail in Europe: a coalition was formed between
powers having different interests against a single
state whose ruin they desired.'</p>

<p>Besides the Emperor Maximilian and Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>,
Ferdinand of Aragon and Pope Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span> were included
in the treaty and 'whoso else should claim
that the Venetians were occupying any of his territory.'
A pious preamble set forth the common
desire of these princes to begin the crusade against
the enemies of the name of Christ, and the obstacles
that the Venetians offered to this holy purpose by
ambitiously occupying cities that belonged to the
Church; these obstacles the allies proposed to remove,
in order afterwards to proceed unitedly to
such a holy and necessary expedition. 'In the
division of the spoils the Pope was to have Faenza,
Rimini, Ravenna, and Cervia, which no doubt did
belong to the Holy See, in the same way as the rest
of Romagna might be said to belong to the Papal
States; Maximilian was to have Padua, Vicenza, and
Verona, as belonging to him in the name of the
Empire, and Friuli and Treviso as pertaining to the
House of Austria; the King of France, Cremona,
the Ghiradadda, Brescia, Bergamo, and Crema; the
King of Spain to have back Trani, Brindisi, Otranto,
and the other ports on the Neapolitan coast which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
had been given in pledge to Venice for sums of
money advanced to the late King Ferdinand <span class="smcap">II.</span> of
Naples. The Pope hesitated and temporised, although
he had been the original instigator of the League.
It was only after he had attempted to make terms
on his own account that he ratified the League at
the end of the year.'<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>'It is therefore solely jealousy and cupidity which
united so many hostile powers against a state that
some had good reason to uphold and others no reason
to fear.'<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Margaret's joy at the success of this negotiation,
so disastrous to the political interests of France and
Italy, breaks forth in the letter she wrote to the
King of Aragon's ambassadors in England immediately
after the treaty was signed. She informs
them that 'she has concluded all the affairs she had
to transact with the Cardinal of Amboise at Cambray
to her satisfaction, and thanks the King of England,
whose ambassadors have assisted her. She has communicated
the secret matter to the English ambassadors,
in order that they may inform their master
of it.' Cambray, December 10th, 1508.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The proceedings between the allies were kept so
secret that the Venetian ambassador, Antonio Condelmerio,
who had followed the Cardinal of Amboise
to Cambray, had no idea of the real facts, and even
wrote to the republic that they could rely more than
ever on Louis <span class="smcap">XII</span>.'s friendship and support. At last
the allies announced their intention of uniting to
make war upon the Infidels, and tried to pick a
quarrel with the Venetians by reproaching them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
with placing obstacles in the way of their carrying
out this holy object, which, they said, obliged them
to force the Venetians to restore what they had
usurped, for the glory and good of Christianity. On
April 16th, 1509, the French herald formally declared
war to the Venetians, in terms which, as the
Doge Leonardo Loredan remarked, were 'fitting
rather to be used against Saracens and Turks, than
made to a most Christian republic.' The French
vanguard had already begun hostilities on the previous
day. Pope Julius followed on the 22nd, and
Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> crossed the Alps with a large army and
arrived at Milan.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May 1509 the battle of Agnadel
was fought, which broke the power of Venice and
decided the fate of the war, victory being with the
French. In writing to inform Margaret of the
battle of Agnadel, Maximilian says: 'Our ambassador,
Adrian de Burgo, who was present at this
victory, writes that he has seen quite four thousand
dead. Through other letters from France we hear
that there are from ten to twelve thousand men
either dead or taken prisoners, and that our said
brother and cousin (Louis <span class="smcap">XII</span>.) has taken forty pieces
of artillery. We also hear that the Venetians were
twenty thousand strong, and the French force rather
stronger.' So far the emperor had not taken an
active part in the great struggle. The low state of
his finances and the war with Gueldres had kept him
in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>On March 31st the States met at Antwerp and
had voted a subsidy of 500,000 crowns as a
gift to Maximilian and the Archduke Charles in
acknowledgment of the services rendered by the
former in defence of the country and in concluding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
the Peace of Cambray. At the same time a sum of
sixty thousand pounds was voted for the Archduchess
Margaret in recognition of the trouble she had taken
in arranging the peace.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> had seized Brescia and Bergamo
almost without a struggle. The Venetian
army retreated as far as Mestre, whilst the French
advanced to Fusino. Maximilian at the head of a
powerful force approached Venice from the other
side. The Venetians, surrounded by enemies and
left without a single ally, shut themselves up in
their capital as their last refuge. This rapid success,
however, proved fatal to the Confederacy. The
memorable decree followed, by which Venice released
her Continental provinces from their allegiance,
authorising them to provide for their own safety.
The allies, who had remained united during the
struggle, now quarrelled over the division of the
spoil. Old jealousies revived, and the Venetians,
taking advantage of their opportunity, recovered part
of the territory which they had lost, and appeased the
Pope and Ferdinand by concessions in their favour,
and at length dissolved the Confederacy which had
brought their commonwealth to the brink of ruin.</p>

<p>Prescott says: 'The various negotiations carried
on during this busy period, and the different combinations
formed among powers hitherto little connected
with each other, greatly increased the intercourse
amongst the European nations; while the greatness
of the objects at which different nations aimed, the
distant expeditions which they undertook, as well as
the length and obstinacy of the contest in which they
engaged, obliged them to exert themselves with a
vigour and perseverance unknown in the preceding
ages.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>MARGARET'S CORRESPONDENCE</h3>

<p class="p2">After a reign of twenty-three years Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>
died at Richmond on the 21st of April 1509,
and the whole aspect of affairs was suddenly
changed. He, like his rival Ferdinand, had been
avaricious from deliberate policy; and his avarice
was largely instrumental in founding England's coming
greatness, for the accumulated riches he left to
his son lent force to the new position assumed by
England as the balancing power, courted by both the
great Continental rivals. The new king, Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>,
was a very different man from his father. From the
time when he ascended the throne, at the age of
eighteen, he adopted an opposite policy.</p>

<p>Ambitious and incautious, and immeasurably vain,
he courted rather than evaded diplomatic complications.
The death of Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> had indeed cleared
away many obstacles; Ferdinand had profoundly
mistrusted him, but with the younger Henry as king
affairs stood differently. Even before his father's
death Ferdinand had taken pains to assure him of
his love, and had treated him as a sovereign over the
old king's head.</p>

<p>The news of Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>'s death was longer in
reaching Spain than might have been expected.
First a courier arrived from Flanders, who had met
another Spanish courier in France, who came from
England, and informed him that King Henry was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
dead. Thus King Ferdinand remained for some time
in uncertainty whether his adversary was dead or
alive. He did not wait for the arrival of positive
news, but at once ratified the treaty of marriage
between Prince Charles and the Princess Mary.
King Ferdinand may have preferred a Portuguese
alliance for his grandson, or a marriage with the
Princess of Bohemia; but the chief advantage was
that no immediate danger was attached to the English
marriage. As Prince Charles was only nine
years old, King Ferdinand could trust to time, and
felt tolerably sure to find more than one pretext for
breaking off the engagement before the betrothal
could become an indissoluble union.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of June 1509 Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> married
Princess Katharine of Aragon, his brother Arthur's
widow, and on the 24th of the same month their
coronation took place at Westminster.</p>

<p>On the 17th of July the new king wrote to his
father-in-law, King Ferdinand, to inform him that
he and Queen Katharine had been solemnly crowned
on the day of St. John the Baptist. He mentions
that his father died a good Catholic, after having
received the holy Sacrament; and that his burial
had been magnificent.</p>

<p>Henry adds that 'he diverts himself with jousts,
birding, hunting, and other innocent and honest pastimes,
also in visiting different parts of his kingdom;
but does not on that account neglect affairs of state.'</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Maximilian had gone to Trent,
and from there had written to thank Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> for
having helped him to recover his former territories.
As a proof of his eternal gratitude he mentions that
he has burnt his 'red book,' which was kept at Spire,
in which he entered all his grievances against France.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
As a sign of friendship Louis sent the Cardinal of
Amboise to meet Maximilian at Trent with promises
to provide him with four thousand men. The
emperor in return conferred upon Louis a new investiture
of the duchy of Milan, including the newly
won towns and territories.</p>

<p>A day was fixed for a meeting between the
emperor and the French king near the border
town of Garde. Louis kept the rendezvous, but
Maximilian did not go farther than Riva di Trento;
after staying there for two hours, he abruptly returned
to Trent and sent word to Louis that he had
been recalled on matters of urgent business, but
begged for another interview at Cremona, which he
promised faithfully to attend. The indecision shown
by Maximilian in this instance has been attributed
to suspicions he entertained as to his old enemy's
good faith. But Louis was naturally annoyed at
these marks of distrust, and being anxious to recross
the Alps, he returned to Milan without waiting any
longer for his ally.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for King Ferdinand that Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>
had been excluded from the League of Cambray, as
it left his son (Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>) free to act as he thought
convenient. The Spanish king resolved to make use
of his son-in-law's liberty, and wrote a letter to his
daughter Katharine on the 13th of September in
which he spoke in general terms of the affairs of
Venice, and referred her to an accompanying letter
in cipher, in which his views on the subject were
fully detailed. In replying on the 1st of November,
King Henry thanked his father-in-law for having
communicated to him his views on Venetian affairs,
praised his wisdom and moderation in rejecting his
confederates' iniquitous proposal to entirely destroy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Venice, and enlarged on the necessity of preserving
the republic, which formed a wall against the Turks.
Before the month was out Henry was a zealous
advocate of the Venetian republic, and interfered in
its behalf in Rome, in France, and with the emperor,
furnishing King Ferdinand at the same time with an
excellent pretext for advising his allies to reconsider
the question whether Venice should be destroyed or
not. The voice of England was, after a long interruption,
heard once more in the councils of Europe
on a measure of general policy. The King of France
seems to have regarded the unexpected audacity of
his young neighbour with a feeling of surprise
mingled with contempt. King Louis' answer was
very uncivil, and Frenchmen boasted openly that
they would soon make war upon England in order to
punish her for her arrogance. As for these threats
King Ferdinand truly observed that France was not
in a position to attack England.</p>

<p>In 1509 the Venetians, taking advantage of Maximilian's
vacillation, recaptured Padua. The surrounding
population and peasantry immediately rose
in favour of the republic, which recovered the town
and fortress of Legnago. Padua's capitulation did
not prevent Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> from recrossing the Alps after
he had concluded a new treaty with Pope Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span>
at Biagrassa, in which they mutually promised to
help each other. Maximilian now decided to crush
the republic by a decisive blow in laying siege to
the capital. But although Louis seemed to agree
with this plan, the Pope disapproved, and Ferdinand
formally opposed it.</p>

<p>The emperor finding it impossible to lay siege to
Venice without help from his allies, prepared to retake
Padua; but after sixteen days of firm resistance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
from the Venetian garrison, he withdrew to Limini,
on the way to Treviso. From there he went to
Vicenza and Verona, bitterly complaining of the
treatment he had received from the Pope and the
King of France, because the former had consented
to receive the Venetian ambassadors, and the latter
had caused the loss of Padua through his delay
in sending help. Having failed to retake Legnago,
Maximilian seemed inclined to make a truce
with Venice, but the republic turned a deaf ear to
his advances, and he returned to Trent discontented
with himself and his allies.</p>

<p>Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span>'s changeable policy increased the dissensions
which undermined the League. In spite of
remonstrances from Maximilian's and Louis' envoys,
Julius wished to receive the Venetian ambassadors
and pardon the republic. He was secretly encouraged
in this by the King of Aragon and openly by
the Archbishop of York, representing Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>
Julius thought he could save the republic by overthrowing
the French rule in Italy, and for this reason
he made friends with England, and encouraged the
Swiss in their discontent with France.</p>

<p>In a long letter to his daughter Queen Katharine,
written on November 18th, 1509, King Ferdinand
says 'that he has touched on the subject of the
preservation of Venice in his negotiations with the
King of France, but very cautiously and without
discovering his plans, his intention being to keep his
negotiations secret until he has won over Maximilian.
He tells Katharine that a short time ago Madame
Margaret sent her secretary to him. The secretary
spoke about the alliance, but he (Ferdinand) intends
to make a further communication to Madame Margaret,
who is the person who has the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
influence with her father, and she would think herself
honoured if so important a business as the conclusion
of the alliance were intrusted to her hands.
He begs Katharine to see that the English envoy
who is sent to Madame Margaret is an honest, intelligent,
and discreet man,' and adds, 'he must go
alone and not be accompanied by any other person,
and it is necessary that he should be able to speak
and express himself well on the subject he has in
hand.'<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>In the following December Miguel Perez Almazan,
King Ferdinand's First Secretary of State, wrote
to Margaret's secretary to inform him that news
had arrived that the King of France intended seizing
the cities of Verona and Vicenza; and that he was
also making preparations to besiege Venice on
every side. 'If he should carry out his designs he
would probably become master of Italy and perhaps
of Christendom, unless the emperor and King
Ferdinand take prompt means to stop him, which
they ought to do for the sake of their common
grandson, Prince Charles.' Almazan goes on to state
that Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> had sent a letter to King Ferdinand,
in which he expressed a wish to enter into a close
alliance with Spain and the emperor. If such an
alliance were concluded the King of France would
be kept from injuring the allies.</p>

<p>'This letter,' he says, 'is sent in order that the
secretary may use his influence with Madame
Margaret, and induce her to help forward the
alliance between the emperor, Spain, and England;
a task which is certainly not difficult for her, and
the execution of which would secure her lasting
fame.'<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Whilst Maximilian was trying to extract a subsidy
for the continuance of the Venetian war from the
Diet at Augsburg, Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span> was maturing his plans.
When the Venetian ambassadors accepted his proposed
treaty (24th of February 1510), he took them
back into favour, and solemnly gave them absolution.</p>

<p>Subjects and vassals of the Church were bidden
to help the republic, and Julius openly quarrelled
with the Duke of Ferrara, who wished to remain
faithful to the League of Cambray. He urged
Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> to declare war against France, and King
Ferdinand secretly did the same. As the Pope
observed, the object of the League of Cambray
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>At this crisis Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> lost his faithful friend and
able Minister, Cardinal d'Amboise. He was succeeded
by Florimond Robertet, who had none of his
predecessor's great qualities. The Cardinal died at
Lyons on the 26th of May 1510. André de Burgo
was then Austrian ambassador at the French Court,
and writing to inform Margaret of the Cardinal's
death, he says, 'I assure you your House has suffered
a great loss.'</p>

<p>Encouraged by the death of Georges d'Amboise,
the Pope continued to make preparations, and
declared that God had chosen him to be the
Liberator of Italy. In spite of his age and infirmities
he was present at the siege of Mirandola, in
January 1511, and entered the town by a breach.</p>

<p>In 1512 he concluded a treaty with King Ferdinand
and the Venetian republic, which the allies
called the 'Holy League.' The apparent object of
this League was to defend the unity of the Church,
and restore the ecclesiastical state; but the real
object was directed against France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span>'s designs were helped by the Swiss, who
entered Italy more than sixteen thousand strong,
determined to re-establish Maximilian Sforza in the
duchy of Milan; but the Pope and his allies received
a check when a new general appeared at the head of
the French army. Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> had made his nephew,
Gaston de Foix, Duke of Nemours, Governor of
Lombardy. This young general of twenty-three
soon distinguished himself by winning three victories
in three months. By a well-planned march he
brought help to the town of Milan, which was left
without means of defence; and forced the Swiss to
recross the mountains. He then obliged the Army
of the League to raise the siege of Bologna. After
reconquering Brescia, which was occupied by the
Venetians, he marched on Ravenna, garrisoned by
papal and Spanish soldiers. But his troops had
hardly begun the attack when the Army of the
League arrived with reinforcements. A battle took
place on Easter Sunday, April 11th, 1512, outside the
walls of Ravenna. Gaston de Foix, in the moment
of victory, was surrounded, thrown from his horse
and killed, as he was charging the retreating
Spaniards. His death was disastrous to the French
cause in Italy.</p>

<p>When Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span> heard of Gaston's victories it is
reported that he tore his beard with rage. One of
Margaret's correspondents writes: 'Madame, there
is news from Rome ... that after the Pope heard
that the Venetians had taken Brescia, he expressed
the greatest joy imaginable, and ordered the bells of
Rome to be rung, fireworks, and many other rejoicings;
but since he heard that his people and the
Spaniards had retired from Bologna, he was much
displeased, and caused a strong and furious letter to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
be written to the Viceroy of Naples, captain of the
said Spaniards, ordering them to return to Bologna
at once, and on no account to leave; and, moreover,
when he heard that the French had retaken Brescia
and slaughtered the Venetians, they say he tore his
beard with rage.'</p>

<p>During this struggle the emperor remained
passive. Although he agreed to Louis' proposed
reforms, he evaded his promise to send German
bishops to the Council the French king had convoked
at Lyons. The truth was that Margaret had forbidden
the bishops to attend. Louis naturally complained,
and threatened the princess with his
Government's displeasure. Margaret replied to
his threats by reproaching him with his conduct
in reference to the Duke of Gueldres. He protested
that he had neither furnished the duke with
men or money, but she would not accept his excuses,
and soon after successfully formed a league between
her father and the Kings of Spain and England,
which league she said represented the mystery of
the Holy Trinity.</p>

<p>Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span> died on the 21st of February 1513. He
had been one of the chief promoters of Italian independence,
and through his warlike policy had considerably
enlarged the papal states.</p>

<p>On the 11th of March 1513 Cardinal John de
Medicis, then in his thirty-sixth year, was unanimously
elected Pope by the twenty-four Cardinals
assembled in conclave. The new Pope (Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span>), who
was of a peaceful and diplomatic nature, refused to
ratify a treaty concluded at Malines on the 5th of
April in the same year between Margaret, acting for
her father, and Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>'s ambassadors; a treaty
which would have forced him to send the papal troops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
to invade Provence or Dauphiny. He arranged a
truce with Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>, who, after Gaston de Foix's
death, had lost most of his Italian possessions. The
Sforzas were reinstated in Milan, the Medicis in
Florence, and Genoa became once more a free
republic; the king's army was beaten by the Swiss
at Novara, and by the English at Guinegate. A
treaty signed at Blois, on the 28th of March, was
ratified at Venice on the 11th of April. The
Venetian republic agreed to help Louis to regain
Milan and Genoa, and the king promised to assist
the Venetians to recover their territories on the
mainland, which were occupied by Maximilian's
troops. The political balance of Europe now depended
entirely on the goodwill of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> On
the 25th of May 1513 Jean le Veau wrote to
Margaret that 'the time had come to be firm, and
that she ought to imitate the English, who always
showed their enmity against France.'</p>

<p>A treaty was concluded through Margaret's intervention
in 1513 between the emperor and Henry
VIII., which aimed at humbling France, but only
resulted in the battle of Guinegate, where Maximilian
served as a volunteer in the English army,
and received a hundred crowns a day as pay. It was
on this occasion that Margaret ordered the town of
Therouenne on the borders of France and Belgium
to be completely destroyed. Whilst he was with
the English army Maximilian sent a messenger to
Margaret asking her to join him at Tournay. In
reply she says: 'Monseigneur, I have received the
message that you have been pleased to send me by
Marnix, my secretary, about my going to Tournay.
As for me, Monseigneur, if you think that my going
there is necessary, and can be of service to you, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
am ready in this and in all else that it may please
you to command me; but otherwise, it is not fitting
for a widow to be trotting about and visiting armies
for pleasure....' But a little later, after the
reduction of Tournay, Margaret met her father and
Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> at Lille.</p>

<p>In June of the same year King Ferdinand wrote
to his ambassador in Flanders 'to tell Madame
Margaret that before and after he concluded the
truce with France in his own name as well as in the
name of the emperor, the King of England, and
Prince Charles, he wrote to his ambassador, Don
Pedro de Urea, and ordered him to explain all his
reasons to the emperor.... Having concluded
the truce from pure necessity, he is forced to observe
it this year.' King Ferdinand tells his ambassador
to beg Madame Margaret to use her influence with
the emperor, and to show him that the policy he has
hitherto adopted can have only one result, viz. 'that
of making the King of France master of the world;
whilst if the emperor follows his (Ferdinand's)
advice, nothing will be lost.'</p>

<p>He writes that 'Madame Margaret is willing to
deliver Don Juan Manuel up to him as prisoner.
She is to be told that Don Juan has not only behaved
badly to King Ferdinand, but also speaks so
ill of her that for this alone he deserves punishment.'<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>And when, a little later, Margaret has asked Maximilian's
permission to arrest Don Juan Manuel, because
he had spoken against King Ferdinand, Maximilian
answers that 'if Don Juan has committed a
crime which is punishable according to law, he may
be arrested; if not, it will be sufficient to banish him
from the Court.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
But although Margaret as Governess of the Netherlands
took part in the greatest events of her century,
yet her private life in her home at Malines was of the
simplest and most domestic kind. We get a very good
idea of the way she spent her days from her interesting
correspondence and from her father's letters which
have, fortunately, been preserved. These letters are
in French, but Maximilian's spelling is chiefly euphonical,
and the meaning often obscure. In spite of
the quaint style, these letters form an interesting
history of Europe at the dawn of the Renaissance.
Beginning with the drama which opens at the League
of Cambray, in which England, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Italy, and Spain all play their parts,
and ending with the disaster of Pavia, the humbling
of France, and the triumph of the House of Austria,
there is not a negotiation, war, or treaty, whose
secret cause and real origin is not disclosed. Although
the correspondence comprises a comparatively short
period, and does not go much beyond the first quarter
of the sixteenth century, still the age was one of
thrilling interest and brilliant personality. Amongst
the illustrious personages who pass in review before
us are Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>, Anne of Brittany, Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>, Louise
of Savoy, Margaret of Angoulême, the Cardinal of
Amboise, and the Chevalier Bayard, Ferdinand of
Aragon, Gonzalva of Cordova, and Ximenes, Henry
<span class="smcap">VII.</span>, Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, and Cardinal Wolsey, Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
and Luther.</p>

<p>Margaret's correspondents included most of the
sovereigns of Europe and their various ambassadors.
Besides the personages already mentioned, we come
across the names of Raulin, Carondelet, Alberto Pio,
the Cardinal of Gurk, Caulier, and Laurent de Gorrevod,
to whose conferences and intrigues we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
introduced, and sometimes to the snares they laid for
their best friends. Amongst them we find André de
Burgo, Maximilian's 'faithful councillor' and ambassador
in France, whose despatches to Malines are
masterpieces of finesse and diplomacy. The pages in
which he describes the events of which Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span> is
the hero are full of interest. In a witty and delightful
manner he records the ambitions, cabals, and
various factions which hastened the end of this
warrior pontiff who was 'always dying but never
buried.' He frequently announces that the Holy
Father is the victim of a violent fever, and that the
doctors hardly hope to save him&mdash;it is whispered that
he will be 'in paradise before a year and a half is out.'
The Cardinals prepare to 'choose a good and holy
Pope,' but before they can do so, the dying Pope
recovers, or at least he is 'so much better that he
thinks himself cured and has lost his fever.'</p>

<p>Then there is André de Burgo's successor, Chancellor
Perrenot, the father of Cardinal de Granvelle.
Also the Granvelles' enemy, Mercurin de Gattinare,
a skilled diplomatist and picturesque writer. More
than once we read of his reminding Margaret of the
respect she owes him, and he tells her, not without
pride, that she does not deserve to have a servant
like himself, and when she gave him some unmerited
rebuke, he replied: 'These words should be addressed
to a stranger and an unknown man, not to me, whom
you have known and tried.'</p>

<p>In Margaret's time Malines was a flourishing commercial
city, whose manufactures were exported to
all parts of Europe. Commerce, industries, and
navigation had made great progress under her wise
rule. Her palace was the centre of life in the old
city and the meeting-place of many illustrious families
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
and learned men who came from all parts of the
Netherlands to visit her Court. Jean Second,
Erasmus, Cornelius Agrippa, Jean Lemaire, Mabuse,
Coxcie, and Van Orley were amongst her frequent
guests.</p>

<p>One of her chief ladies was the Countess of Hochstrate,
who had charge of her maids of honour and
the women of her household. Her husband, Count
Hochstrate, was the princess's chevalier d'honneur,
and commanded her bodyguard of twenty-seven
noblemen, whose duty it was to attend her wherever
she went. He also was in charge of the stewards,
cooks, pastrycooks, bakers, cupbearers, carvers and
the other servants, besides the keeper of Prince
Charles's lions and rare birds, so that his post was
no sinecure.</p>

<p>Margaret took great pride in keeping up an establishment
worthy of her rank. She lived in great luxury,
and her table was always furnished with the choicest
wines, and every kind of fish, fowl, and game in its
season. In spite of her habitual melancholy, she took
part in the usual amusements of her time. We read
of her attending many feasts, dances, and jousts; and
it was seldom she did not have music during her
meals, either fife, tambourin, or violin players, or
sometimes the choristers of Notre-Dame de Sablon,
or Monsieur de Ravestein's singers, who played and
sang songs before her. Another day we read of her
watching the performance of 'two large and powerful
bears' brought by some strolling Hungarian players;
or sitting in the vast hall, silent and dreamy, listening
to old airs of German minstrelsy.</p>

<p>Maximilian occasionally visited his daughter, and
then Malines was <i>en fête</i>. Sometimes he invited
his young granddaughters to spend a few days with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
him at Brussels, 'to see the park and enjoy themselves.'<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>But Margaret's favourite occupation was superintending
the education of her nephew Charles. She
had a wonderful aptitude for teaching, and was not
satisfied that he should excel in manly sports, which
was usually all that was required of princes, but she
insisted on his studying history, languages, and science.
She also found time for more domestic employments.
From the letters we find that she spun flax, and
amongst the objects mentioned in her inventory are
a spindle, distaff, and winding reels. She was accustomed
to work with her needle, and once she surprised
her father by sending him 'good linen shirts,'
which she had made herself, and Maximilian, delighted
with this present, hastened to thank her: 'I
have received by this bearer some beautiful shirts
and "huves" which you have helped to make with
your own hand, with which I am delighted....
Our skin will be comforted with meeting the fineness
and softness of such beautiful linen, such as the angels
in Paradise use for their clothing.' Margaret also
sent her father receipts for various dishes which
pleased her, and we find her recommending him to
eat some preserves during the heat of summer which
she has tried herself and found excellent. 'I have
a good apothecary,' she says, 'called Countess de
Horne, who takes care to supply me every year with
the best preserves in the world, which she makes
with her own hands, and as I find them good, it
seems to me that you will also, even in this great
heat.'</p>

<p>Margaret took much interest in her maids of honour,
and when necessary did not spare them either advice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
or punishment. She warned them especially to avoid
gossiping or foolish conversation. During the long
winter evenings she played chess, or when summer
came with long fine days, she rode with them through
the forests of Scheplaken, Groenendael, and Boisfort,
followed by her greyhounds. If one of her maids
married, Margaret took care to prepare the trousseau.
Sometimes she put aside a certain sum for this purpose
from her privy purse, and often begged a post
from Maximilian for the girl's future husband. Thus
she dowered and provided for many maidens whose
names are mentioned in the Archives of Lille.</p>

<p>As a rule, Margaret and her father treated each
other with the greatest confidence. Maximilian took a
fatherly interest in whatever concerned his daughter's
happiness. He would like to have seen her married
to Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, for then, as he said, she would not have
been 'a person lost and forgotten.' Sometimes he
made her small presents, 'a carbuncle which his father
the Emperor Frederick had valued,' or a haunch of
venison off which she could 'feast at some dinner or
supper.' On another occasion he sent her the plan of
a triumphal arch before 'having it erected, so that it
might remain for ever as a monument to their perpetual
glory.'</p>

<p>One day, in a fit of rare generosity (for he was very
impecunious), he made her a present of 100,000 crowns.
Margaret will be ungrateful, he says, 'if she is not
well pleased with him.' He tells her his most secret
thoughts ... that he intends soliciting the papal
tiara, for the Pope 'cannot live long.' He wishes to
be nominated coadjutor of the Sovereign Pontiff, so
as 'to be assured of having the Papacy and becoming
a priest and afterwards made holy.' With this intention
he begins to 'win over the cardinals' with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
two or three thousand ducats, and he sends 'a messenger
to the King of Aragon, begging him to help
him to get what he wants.'</p>

<p>But this confidence between the emperor and his
daughter was often broken. Maximilian sometimes
complains that she treats him badly and 'takes him
for a Frenchman!' She was not always his 'good
daughter;' she sometimes speaks too plainly and asks
him when he intends sending an answer to the English
ambassadors, who have been kept waiting for eight
months, and reminds him ironically 'that it is time to
move in this business.' On another occasion she
writes these words in a letter which he calls 'rude
and ungracious': 'I know that it is not my business
to interfere in your said affairs, as I am an inexperienced
woman in such matters, nevertheless the great
duty I have towards you emboldens me to ...
beg of you ... to take care whilst there is yet
time.'</p>

<p>But in spite of these small recriminations each
tried to help the other, as we see from the numerous
requests they constantly made to each other in favour
of various persons in whom they were interested. In
spite of the Netherlands' general prosperity, both
Margaret and her father suffered greatly from lack
of funds, as is shown in nearly every page of the
correspondence. Maximilian hardly writes a letter
without mentioning that he has need of 'a sum of
money.' One day he humbly begs for 10,000 florins,
another time for 70,000 or 80,000, which he must have.
He knows, he says, that the States complain that he
only thinks of 'knavery and taking their money for
nothing,' but all the same he begs Margaret to do all
in her power to find him the sum he requires. His
lamentations, resources, and importunity in begging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
are most pitiable. 'We must,' he says, 'in order to
raise money quickly, pawn two gold chains set with
many valuable and precious stones, one (chain) being
larger than the other.' Sometimes Margaret was as
hardly pressed for funds as her father, and several of
her letters have this sad ending, 'The treasurer does
not know where to turn for money; he has no
"deniers" (old Roman coins) left.' The Swiss and
German infantry were unpaid, and Maximilian for
this reason kept out of the way, and fled to the
Tyrolese mountains on the pretext of hunting. His
daughter wrote to him severely: 'I hoped that you
would have come here, but from what I see, you are
going further and further away, which displeases me,
for it was very necessary that you should come here.'
At another time she tells him that she will be forced
to become 'bankrupt' if she cannot quickly raise
'24,000 florins from the King of England.' She has
appealed to the States in vain; for some 'cannot
agree,' whilst others 'have settled nothing yet ... for
they are obstinate and disagreeable.'</p>

<p>Even the ambassadors were hampered by lack of
means. André de Burgo could not go to Lyons,
where he was afraid to stay for want of money. 'It
is a pity,' he says, 'for so good and loyal a servant of
your house to have so often to beg and ask for the
wherewithal to live, as God's poor do ... he is
ashamed not to be able to pay his creditors, and shall
be reduced to sell half his plate to some Jew.'</p>

<p>Even Mercurin de Gattinare had to give up an
important journey, and states he will have to go
'bankrupt' if he cannot sell a gold chain. For Anne of
Brittany's accouchement the other ambassadors had
ordered coloured clothes; he alone has to appear in
black garments, and is much distressed. 'I have only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
black,' he writes in Italian, 'and have no means of
buying colours.'</p>

<p>Besides these oft-recurring complaints, the correspondence
is full of the hatred which Margaret and
her father still felt for France. Maximilian never
liked the French, and his letters abound in maledictions
against them. He tries to stir up his daughter's
aversion, and congratulates her 'on the goodwill and
diligence she has shown in resisting them. We have,'
he says, 'more experience of the French than you
have ... and we would rather you were deceived
by their fair speeches than ourselves, so that you
would take more care in future.' He knows their
'treachery and falseness,' for they only act by abuse,
dissimulation, and deceit, as they have done for the
last hundred years past, and will still be doing a
hundred years hence.</p>

<p>Maximilian himself served as a private soldier in
the King of England's army on the Continent, and
advised Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> to land at Crotoy, where he
proposed meeting him 'on condition that his said
brother gave him the money he had promised, and
that he sent the second portion with the first.'
Margaret certainly shared her father's aversion for
all things French, although she disguised it in writing
to Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> She secretly rejoices at every French
defeat, and when she hears of the victory of Guinegate,
'she is more happy than she can say.' She also
reminds Maximilian of old wrongs to rouse up his
wrath, and ironically recalls 'the good faith and
loyalty of the French.' Several times she points out
how easy it would be to conquer their hereditary
enemy: 'There is no boundary between our country
and France, and you know the deep inveterate hatred
the French bear us.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
These words express all Margaret's hatred and
ambition, and show one of the reasons why she took
such a special care of Prince Charles's education.
In him she hoped to see realised all her dreams of
the future greatness of Austria and Burgundy. With
infinite trouble she directed his masters and mistresses,
was herself present at their lessons, and
often interceded with Maximilian on their behalf.
Thus she recommends Anne de Beaumont 'for the
first vacant post over the ladies of the household ...
or a good annual pension, as a reward for her past
services, which ought to be noticed'; she also praises
Louis Vacca 'for great and worthy service which he
has daily rendered as tutor for eight years, teaching
Monseigneur with such great care and diligence, as
a good and loyal servitor should.'</p>

<p>We read of the child's rapid progress in his lessons,
and also of a fever he caught after attending his sister
Isabel's wedding, at which 'he behaved as a good
brother, accompanying his sister in the dances so
perfectly, and perhaps rather more than was good
for him.' A few days later 'he began to get better,'
and it is hoped that he 'will soon be restored to
health,' as he has such a good appetite 'that now it
is difficult to satisfy him.' He is learning to shoot,
but it is dangerous for the passers-by, as he shot
a man by mistake, 'when Monseigneur, my nephew,
went to play at Wure. On Whit-Monday he fired
off his gun, and had the misfortune to kill a workman
of this town, a drunkard and ill-conditioned man ...
which has caused my said Lord and me much sorrow
and regret, but there is no help for it.'</p>

<p>When the boy went hunting near Malines Maximilian
wrote joyfully: 'We are well pleased that our
son Charles takes so much pleasure in hunting,' but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
at the same time he recommends, 'when the weather
is mild, to send him to Anvers and Louvain to take
the air, and to pass the time, to ride on horseback
for his health and strength.'</p>

<p>Maximilian then goes on to describe his own sport.
He has taken 'at least four large stags in the morning,
and after dinner five herons. Ducks and kites we
catch daily without number; even to-day we got
four herons besides, and thirteen ducks or river birds
in twelve flights in one half league. Every day we
get three kites, for here there is any amount, and
all in the most beautiful country....'</p>

<p>These few quotations will show that the letters are
more or less memoirs of Margaret's life for about
twenty-five years, and give us a good idea of the
part she played in the stirring events of her time.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>A LOVE AFFAIR</h3>

<p class="p2">After the reduction of Tournay and Therouenne
in the autumn of 1513, Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and
Maximilian met Margaret at Lille. She
was accompanied by the Archduke Charles and a
large retinue. This was Henry's first meeting with
his wife's nephew; it was also Margaret's first introduction
to the man whose engaging manners and
brilliant personality nearly made her give up the
resolution to which she had adhered for so many
years, and marry again.</p>

<p>Amongst Henry's <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>'s officers was Sir Charles
Brandon, one of the handsomest men of his time, and
a great favourite with the English king, who, in May
1513, had been created Viscount Lisle. The new
Lord Lisle had accompanied his master to the war
in France, being marshal of the host and captain
of the foreward, with 3000 men under him. Hall,
in his Chronicle, gives the following interesting
account of the meeting of Margaret and Charles
Brandon:&mdash;'Monday, the 11th day of October, the
king without the town received the Prince of Castile,
the Lady Margaret, and divers other nobles of their
countries, and them brought into Tournay with great
triumph. The noise went that the Lord Lisle made
request of marriage to the Lady Margaret, Duchess
of Savoy, and daughter to the Emperor Maximilian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
which before that time was departed from the king
with many rich gifts and money borrowed; but,
whether he proffered marriage or not, she favoured
him highly. There the prince and duchess sojourned
with great solace by the space of ten days. On the
18th of October the jousts began, the king and Lord
Lisle answered all comers. Upon the king attended
twenty-eight knights on foot, in coats of purple
velvet and cloth of gold. A tent of cloth of gold
was set in the place for the armoury and relief.
The king had a base and a trapper of purple
velvet both set full of fine bullion, and the Lord
Lisle in the same suit. There were many spears
broken, and many a good buffet given; the strangers,
as the Lord Walon and the Lord Emery, and
others, did right well. When the jousts were done,
the king and all the others unhelmed them, and
rode about the tilt, and did great reverence to the
ladies, and then the heralds cried, "To lodging!"</p>

<p>'This night the king made a sumptuous banquet
of a hundred dishes to the Prince of Castile and
the Lady Margaret, and to all the other lords and
ladies, and after the banquet the ladies danced;
and then came in the king and eleven in a masque,
all richly apparelled with bonnets of gold, and when
they had passed the time at their pleasure, the garments
of the masque were cast off amongst the
ladies, take who could take.</p>

<p>'The 20th day of October, the Prince of Castile
and the Lady Margaret, with many great gifts
to them given, returned to Lille with all their
train.'</p>

<p>A few months after this meeting Lord Lisle was
created Duke of Suffolk (February 1st, 1514) on the
same day that the dukedom of Norfolk was restored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
to the Howards, and when there was only one other
peerage of that grade, namely, Buckingham, existing
in England.</p>

<p>In October Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> wrote to Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span> to tell
him that he had conquered Tournay, and that the
French ran away so quickly that it was impossible
for him to follow them. He also mentions that he
has conferred with the emperor and the Archduchess
Margaret about the affairs of the Prince of Castile,
and especially about the marriage of the prince with
his sister, the Princess Mary. He mentions that
'Prince Charles came in person to Tournay.'</p>

<p>In the following May, when in England, the king
and the new Duke of Suffolk were present at a
tournament and 'defenders at the tilt against all
comers,' dressed as black and white hermits, having
the following motto written in white letters on their
black staves: 'Who can hold that will away.' Gossip
said that this posy was made for the Duke of Suffolk
and the Duchess of Savoy.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Henry soon grew alarmed when
rumours reached him that his favourite was thinking
of marrying Margaret. He at once wrote to Maximilian
expressing his annoyance, and the same day
(the 4th of March) sent a letter to Margaret enclosing
the one he had written to her father, leaving it
to her discretion to forward it or not as she thought
best. King Henry says, ... 'Because it has come
to our knowledge that the common report is in divers
places that marriage is contemplated between you
and our very dear and loyal cousin and councillor,
the Duke of Suffolk, we are making all possible
diligence to know and hear from whence this report

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
to be inflicted, that all other inventors and
sowers of lies will take example from it.'</p>

<p>The following letters, referring to the subject, are
in the handwriting of the English ambassador, Sir
Richard Wingfield, to whom Margaret addressed
herself. They were evidently translated from the
French, in which the originals were written, and
were either translated by Sir Richard, or he transcribed
the version, the matter being so secret for
his despatches home:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="left5">MS. Cotton.</p>

<p>'My Lord the Ambassador,&mdash;Since that I see
that I may not have tidings from the emperor so
soon, it seemeth me that I should do well no longer
for to tarry to despatch this gentleman. And for
that by my letters addressing unto the king and to
the duke, of that I dare not adventure me to write
unto them so at length of this besides, because that
I fear my letters to be evil kept, I me determine
to write to you at length to send that of all ye may
the better them advertise of mine intent.</p>

<p>'Ye may know, my lord the ambassador, that
after some days having been at Tournay, knowing
from day to day the great love and trust that the
king bare and had to the personage which is no
need to name; also with the virtue and grace of his
person, the which me seemed that I had not much
seen gentleman to approach it; also considering the
desire the which always he showed me that he had
to do me service; all these things considered by me,
I have always forced me to do unto him all honour
and pleasure, the which to me seemed to be well
agreeable unto the king his good master; who, as
I may imagine, seeing the good cheer and will the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
which I bare him, with the love which he beareth
unto him, by many times spake unto me, for to know
if this goodwill which I bare unto the said personage
it might stretch unto some effect of promise of marriage,
seeing that it was the fashion of the ladies of
England, and that it was not there holden for evil;
whereunto many times I answered the most graciously
that was to me possible, knowing this thing not to
proceed but of love which he bare him, the several
of reasons wherefore it was not to me possible, unless
I should fall in the evil grace of my father and of all
this country. Also that it was not here the custom,
and that I should be dishonoured, and holden for a
fool and light. But all my reasons might not help
me, that without rest he spake thereof to me. That
seeing, and that he had it so much at the heart, for
him not to anger, I found to him one other reason, to
him saying, that if now I had well the will so for to
do, that yet I nor would nor durst think, seeing his
return to be so nigh, and that it should be to me too
much great displeasure to lose so good company; of
the which he contented him somewhat better, and
passed the thing unto his departing, and then began
to say to me that the departing drew nigh, and that
he knew well I should be pressed for to marry me,
and that I was yet too young for to abide thus; and
that the ladies of his country did remarry at fifty
and threescore years.</p>

<p>'Whereupon I answered that I had never had
will so to do, and that I was too much unhappy in
husbands; but he would not believe me. And after,
by two times, in presence of the personage that ye
know, he returned to say the same words, saying
more, "I know well, madame, and am sure that my
fellow shall be to you a true servant, and that he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
altogether yours, but we fear that ye shall not do in
likewise, for one shall force you to be again married;
and that ye shall not be found out of this country
(<i>i.e.</i> in this country) at my return." That which I
promised to him I should not do; and for that he
desired greatly thereof to be more assured, he made
me to promise in his hand that howsoever I should
be pressed of my father, or otherwise, I should not
make alliance of marriage (with) prince of the world,
at the least unto his return, or the end of the year.
The which I did willingly, for I think not to again
never to put me where I have had so much of
unhappiness and misfortune. And afterwards made
his fellow to do the same, who, as I believe and
seemeth me, said of adventure, as his master me
showed again, that he should never do thing, were
it of marriage, or to take lady nor mistress, without
my commandment, but would continue all his life
my right humble servant; and that it was to him
enough honour, so much honestly, and of so good
sort as was possible. And these words were said at
Tournay in my chamber one night after supper, full
late. The other time was at Lille, the day before
that they should depart, that he spake to me long
at the head of a cupboard, he and his fellow, of the
departing, which was not without displeasure full
great of all persons. And again, after many devises
and regrets, he made me to reconfirm in his hand,
and the same of his fellow, the like promise aforesaid.
And the said personage in my hand, without that I
required him, made me the semblable, and that for
always he should be to me true and humble servant;
and I to him promised to be to him such mistress all
my life as to him who me seemed desired to do me
most of service. And upon this there was no more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
words of this affair, nor hath not been since, if not
some gracious letters, the which have been (enough
or I know) evil kept.'</p></div>

<p>Further as to the words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'And I promise you, my lord the ambassador, that
this is the truth, and I know not other thing. I
cannot tell if the king, which was "trwcheman"
(interpreter), because of the love which he beareth
him, might have taken it more forward for to
interpret more his desire, but the thing is such, and
truth.</p>

<p>'My lord the ambassador, for that it hath been
said unto me that he might have showed a ring
where there is a diamond of mine, that which I
cannot believe, for I esteem him much a man of
virtue and wise, but always I will well show you the
truth, to the end to answer to all. I take none in
this affair to witness but the king and him; and
himself first: it is that one night at Tournay, being
at the banquet, after the banquet he put himself
upon his knees before me, and in speaking and him
playing, he drew from my finger the ring, and put
it upon his, and then showed it me, and I took to
laugh, and to him said that he was a thief, and
that I thought not that the king had with him led
thieves out of his country. This word "laron" he
could not understand; wherefore I was constrained
for to ask how one said "laron" in Flemish. And
afterwards I said to him in Flemish "dieffe," and I
prayed him many times to give it me again, for that
it was too much known. But he understood me not
well, and kept it unto the next day that I spake to
the king, him requiring to make him to give it me,
because it was too much known. I promising him
one of my bracelets the which I wear, the which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
gave him. And then he gave me the said ring, the
which one other time at Lille, being set nigh to my
lady of Hornes, and he before upon his knees, it took
again from my finger. I spake to the king to have
it again, but it was not possible, for he said unto me
that he would give me others better, and that I
should leave him that. I said unto him that it was
not for the value, but for that it was too much
known. He would not understand it, and departed
from me.</p>

<p>'The morrow after he brought me one fair point
of diamonds and a table ruby, and showed me that
it was for the other ring; wherefore I durst no more
speak of it, if not to beseech him that it should not
be showed to any person; the which hath not all
been to me done. (Thus, my lord the ambassador,
see all of this affair, and for to know mine advice
upon all, I shall give it you more at length, which
is this.)</p>

<p>'That if the things had not been so published, the
which I find the most strange of the world, knowing
that creature of the world, at the least on my part,
could thereof never speak, for that which I had said
and done was for not to annoy the king, for I knew
well that it came to him of great love for to speak
so far forth as of marriage. And of another prince
I had not so well taken it as of him, for I hold him
all good, and that he thinketh none evil, wherefore
I have not willed to displease him. And in this
business I have found myself more impeached for to
know that which me seemed touched to the king
than that which me touched.</p>

<p>'By one bylle (note) I shall put you in writing all
the inconveniences which may happen of this thing.
Also that which seemeth to me for the remedy of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to be done; but, for that I have no leisure, I shall
make an end, praying you to do with this that which
the bearer shall say you, and no more. I trow that
ye know this hand.</p>

<p class="right">(Thus signed, M.).'</p></div>

<p>The second writing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'My lord the ambassador,&mdash;Ye may have seen
how the things have been, and ye know the unhappy
bruit which thereof hath run not only here but on
all parts, as well in Germany as in all countries.
Whereof I have found myself so much abashed that
I cannot imagine wherefore this thing is said so
openly as in the hands of merchant strangers. And
for to say you the truth, I have been constrained as
well by the counsel of my servants as of the lord
Berques and others, to make inquiry whereof it
came, and as well by information as writings always
I have found that it proceeded from England.
Whereof I have had a marvellous sorrow. And I
have letters of the self hand of an English merchant,
the which hath been the first that hath made the
wagers, as Bresylle knoweth well. Now, my lord
the ambassador, the king, at the request of the said
Bresylle, and the personage also, have done many
things for to remedy to this fortune, wherein I am
holden unto them, but yet I see that the bruit is so
imprinted in the fantasies of people, and fear if that
it continue long, that all that which is done is not
enough, for I continue always in fear. And also
I know that I may not show towards the personage
the weal and honour which I desire to do as
before.</p>

<p>'For yet I dare not write unto him when I have
anything to do towards the king, nor I dare not only
speak of him. And I am constrained to entreat him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
in all things like a stranger, at the least before folks,
the which doth me so much displeasure that I cannot
write it, seeing that I take him so much for my
good friend and servant; and that I am constrained
so to do, and also I see that to this gentleman only
which is here I dare not speak or look to him.
Whereof I am so much displeased that nothing
more. He himself perceiveth well that every one
beholdeth him of the other side.</p>

<p>'And as to the descent<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> of the king it shall
behove me to speak so soberly as I may me constrain,
for it is the thing that I desire as much as his
coming. And the same of my lady Mary, as God
knoweth. The heart me breaketh when it behoveth
me to dissemble, not in this but in many others.
And it seemeth to me that I may not so well serve
the king, being in this fear, as before; so when the
king shall descend that I shall be always in this pain,
and I feel me I shall not dare speak nor show good
semblance to the said personage; whereas I would
make to him much honour and good cheer, I shall
not dare behold him with a good eye, which displeasure
shall be the same to him and to me. And
I know no remedy<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> but the same that Bresylle shall
show you for to put remedy to all. I would not
constrain him to it against his will, but, and he
desire ever that I do him honour or pleasure, it is
forced that it be so, not for that I have not the good
will towards him, such as ever I have had, but for
that I am for mine honour constrained so to do. I
pray you very much to take pains for to make well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
to understand to the king and to the personage this
thing, to the end that I may do to him better service
and to his fellow pleasure. I pray you to do of this
as of the other.<span class="i3">(Likewise signed, M.).'</span></p>

<p>(Endorsed, Secret matters of the Duke of Suffolk.)</p></div>

<p class="p2">Although these interesting letters are so badly
transcribed from the original French that their
meaning is often obscure, they undoubtedly prove
that Margaret had fallen desperately in love with
the handsome English favourite, who, on his side,
appears to have been more or less serious in his
flirtation with her. How deep were Brandon's
feelings for Margaret we shall probably never know.
It is certain that Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> did not look favourably
on his suit, and as Margaret herself sadly observed
to the English ambassador in her letter quoted
above: 'I know no remedy (to stop the gossip) but
the same that Bresylle shall show you,' namely that
Brandon should look elsewhere for a wife. The
rumours and reports concerning Margaret and the
Duke of Suffolk reached as far as Spain. King
Ferdinand heard of them, and in July he wrote to
Luiz Caroz de Villaragut, his ambassador in England,
asking 'if it is true or not that Madame Margaret
is to marry Monsieur de Lisle (Charles Brandon)?'<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>But in the midst of all these troubles and anxieties
preparations for the first wedding in the little circle
at Malines turned Margaret's thoughts into another
channel.</p>

<p>On Trinity Sunday, the 11th of June 1514, her
niece, Isabel of Austria, was married by proxy to
Christian II., King of Denmark, who had succeeded
to his father's throne the previous year. In a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
letter to Maximilian Margaret gives an interesting
account of the wedding:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blocquote">

<p class="left5">'<span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, <i>the 12th of June</i>.</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,&mdash; ... After the arrival of the
Danish ambassadors on Wednesday last they had
their public audience on Thursday, and visited
Monsieur and Mesdames and delivered their king's
messages with many good words; they then withdrew
until Friday, when I sent the Chancellor of Brabant,
the President of Burgundy, and other deputies to call
upon them.... The next day, which was Saturday,
they expressed a great desire that the marriage
should be solemnised on the following day, which
was Trinity Sunday, on which day the king their
master held the festival of his anointing and coronation.
But, Monseigneur, it was very difficult to
arrange such a solemn function in so short a time,
for it could not be as honourably held as I should
have wished, but, anxious to please them and gratify
their desires, I agreed that the said ceremony should
be held on Trinity Sunday, which was yesterday,
and I did my best to have everything arranged and
put in order. The parties assembled on the said day
between ten and eleven o'clock, with as much state
and honour on our side as was possible, owing to the
short notice, in front of the great hall of this house,
where Monsieur de Cambray gave the promises and
performed the espousals by word of mouth, as was
right between the King of Denmark ... and
Madame Isabel, my niece, whom it certainly did one
good to look at. The said promises given, they went
to hear high mass in this hall; and the ambassadors
were seated according to their rank, he of Spain
beside Monseigneur, to the great content of all, but
those of England were not there because "on ne les
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
scavoit accorder." And when evening came, supper
was served and every one sat down in order, and
after supper there were dances and tourneys until
very late, when they retired to put the bride to bed ... as
is the custom amongst great princes. Thus
all was very solemnly and duly accomplished, to the
great delight of the said ambassadors, who thanked
me very much at their departure; as they had fulfilled
their mission they were anxious to hasten their
return, and I believe they will guard your honour
and that of this house as much as possible....'</p>
</div>

<p>The next day Margaret writes to say that Charles
danced too much at his sister's wedding, and made
himself ill. 'Monseigneur,' she says, 'showed himself
such a good brother, and carried out everything,
even to the dances in which he accompanied the said
lady, his sister, to perfection ... and a little more
perhaps than his constitution could bear, for the day
after the said espousals he was attacked by fever....'
A fortnight later Margaret writes thankfully
to tell her father that Charles is convalescent.</p>

<p>As the Princess Isabel was barely thirteen, it was
arranged that owing to her youth she should remain
at home for another year. When the marriage at
last took place it was not a happy one, the king
being a notorious libertine, who was later known as
'the Nero of the North,' and after a few years of
misery the poor little princess died, leaving her
children to Margaret's care.</p>

<p>Isabel's younger sister, Mary, was sent this year
on a visit to the Court of Hungary, possibly with a
view to her future marriage. Margaret mentions
her journey in several letters. In April she wrote
from Malines: 'Touching the departure of Madame
Mary, all is ready; and she will start from here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
without fail on the 2nd of May ... and will go by
Grave as you advised.'</p>

<p>On the 5th of May Florent of Egmond writes to
Margaret from Maestricht: 'Madame, Madame Mary
arrived here this evening in very good disposition,
without having met any danger on the road to her
person or otherwise; to-morrow we pass from here
to Aix-la-Chapelle.' The princess accomplished her
journey safely, but her marriage to Louis of Hungary
did not take place until seven years later.</p>

<p>In 1507 Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>'s sister, Princess Mary, had
been betrothed to Prince Charles of Austria, and the
marriage contract signed at Calais between her
father, Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>'s, and Maximilian's ambassadors.
It had been arranged that the betrothal should take
place in London before the following Easter; but
the King of England's illness and the emperor's
engagements had delayed the ceremony until the
17th of December 1508. It was agreed to wait for
the completion of the marriage until Charles had
attained his fourteenth year in February 1514.</p>

<p>In the month of October 1513 the king and
emperor still appeared to be willing to fulfil the
contract, and signed a treaty arranging that Maximilian
and Margaret should accompany the Archduke
Charles to Calais before the 15th of May following
for the celebration of the marriage. But six months
later Ferdinand and Louis signed another treaty
agreeing to marry the archduke to Renée, Louis
<span class="smcap">XII.</span>'s daughter, who was barely four years old.
Ferdinand, as Charles's maternal grandfather, claimed
the right to control the marriage of his grandson
and heir. He informed Maximilian of the contents
of the treaty, but begged him to keep it secret from
Margaret, as <i>he</i> intended to keep it secret from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
English king. Margaret, left in ignorance, continued
to beg her father to celebrate the archduke's marriage
with Princess Mary, but the emperor always evaded
her requests with fresh excuses. She reproached
him for his negligence in a letter written in March
1514 in which she showed how necessary it was that
he should hasten the marriage to secure peace to
the Austrian dominions, and especially to the
Netherlands.</p>

<p>Anne of Brittany had been in failing health for
some years, and as far back as 1511 had had a serious
illness which placed her life in danger. De Burgo,
Margaret's ambassador at the French Court, in one
of his letters to his mistress's secretary says: 'The
queen, as I lately informed Madame, was nearly
well again, but last night she was suddenly attacked
with fever and other symptoms so violently that her
life was in danger.' Later on he wrote that the
patient had had such a bad night, she had lost all
power of speech, but after having received the last
sacraments she gradually became better. Anne
recovered, and on the 4th of April De Burgo wrote
the news of her convalescence.</p>

<p>But on the 23rd of January of the following year
Jean Leveau informed Margaret that 'the day before
yesterday, which was the 21st of this month, at
three o'clock in the afternoon, the queen was delivered
of a still-born son, much to the king's grief,
though others take it calmly since God wills it thus.'
This was Anne's last child. In the following March
she again had fever, and did not leave her bed until
May. De Burgo gave Margaret an account of an
audience he had with Anne on the 19th of May.
'Madame, although the queen is not yet quite well
and speaks to no stranger, she was pleased to wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
to see me, to hear what the emperor had written to
me about some days ago, and that I might take leave
of her; I found her in bed, but looking well, and
much improved in health.'</p>

<p>Anne, however, never really recovered, and on
January the 9th, 1514, passed away at Blois, leaving
the king with only two daughters, Claude and Renée.
Ferdinand soon tried to find Louis another wife,
and proposed that he should marry Margaret, who
was now thirty-four years old, or her niece Eleanor,
who was only seventeen. Louis chose the latter,
and had the marriage articles drawn up.</p>

<p>In a long despatch to Juan de Lanuza, his ambassador
in Flanders, written in March, King Ferdinand
says that he hears that Madame Margaret does not
approve of the mission on which Quintana (his
secretary) was sent to the emperor. Quintana was
sent to find out the emperor's wishes about concluding
a truce with France for one year between
Austria, England, and Spain.... Had he believed
that Madame Margaret entertained a different
opinion from that of the emperor, he would have
consulted her first. Not knowing that she would
disapprove of the treaty, and considering delay
dangerous, he had sent Quintana to the emperor,
and ordered that as soon as he arrived, Luis de
Gilaberte should go to Madame Margaret, and
inform her of what was going on. As the truce is
now signed according to the orders of the emperor,
it must be observed....'</p>

<p>'In addition to the commission to conclude a truce
with France ... the emperor ordered Quintana to
propose in his name to the King of France a
marriage with Madame Eleanor of Austria....
King Ferdinand says that he is astonished to hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
that Madame Margaret opposes his plans, as he is
only following her father's counsel, and thinks she
must be imperfectly informed of the true nature of
this affair.... Madame Margaret, he says, dwells
on the great difference of age between the King of
France and Madame Eleanor. Lanuza is to tell her
that in marriages of great kings difference of age is
never taken into account. The King of France has
no son and no heir. A son of Madame Eleanor's
would, therefore, be the heir to the throne of France.
It would be of incalculable advantage to Prince
Charles if his sister's son were King of France.
Madame Margaret is mistaken if she thinks it a
disadvantage that Madame Eleanor is so thin. Thin
women generally ... bear more children than stout
ones. If the King of France were to marry Madame
Eleanor, Austria, France, England, and Spain would
form but one family, of which the emperor would be
the head....'</p>

<p>'Ferdinand hopes that Margaret will not dissuade
the emperor and the King of England from ratifying
the truce with France, and wishes that the marriages
(Prince Charles's and his sister Eleanor's) might be
concluded in her presence and under her guidance.
He goes on to say that Madame Margaret is a very
pious and virtuous lady, and he expects that she
will act like a good Christian, and prefer peace rather
than war and bloodshed.... Should it be necessary,
he must speak with Madame Margaret's confessor in
secret, and ask him to use his influence with her....'
Ferdinand ends the despatch by saying that 'he
hopes Margaret will help him to secure incalculably
great advantages to the emperor, himself, and to
Prince Charles.'</p>

<p>In the same month King Ferdinand wrote a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
affectionate letter to Margaret evidently in the hopes
of winning her consent to his wishes by flattering
speeches. The letter is addressed to his 'beloved
daughter,' and begins by thanking her for all the
great services she has rendered to himself as well as
to 'his brothers, the emperor and the King of England,
and to his son, the Prince (Charles).' 'She is,'
he says, 'the most important person in Christendom,
since she acts as mediator in almost all the negotiations
between the princes of Christendom.'</p>

<p>In another letter to Lanuza a few days later,
Ferdinand is still anxious lest Margaret should
oppose the truce with France, and observes that
'Madame Margaret is the person on whom, more
than any one else on earth, peace or war depends, and
beseeches that she may use her influence in favour of
peace.'</p>

<p>King Ferdinand tells Lanuza in confidence that he
believes Margaret wishes to marry the French king
herself, and that if this is the case, Ferdinand would
not oppose it; but the King of France is anxious to
marry again because he hopes for a son and heir,
and he does not wish to marry Margaret because he
fears that she would not bear him children....<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Whilst these negotiations were under discussion,
Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> was contemplating marrying his sister
Mary to Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>, in order to prevent the French
king's marriage with Eleanor of Austria. It was
now in the King of England's interest to be on good
terms with France, as he was deserted by those who
had formerly sided with him against her. Full
powers for Princess Mary's marriage with Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>
were sent to France on the 29th of July. The next
day Mary solemnly renounced the promises made in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
her name with reference to her marriage with the
Archduke Charles, and on the 7th of August the
marriage contract with Louis was signed in London
by the ambassadors, without Margaret having any
suspicion of the truth.</p>

<p>When at last she heard rumours of the Anglo-French
marriage, she did not believe them, and even
ordered Jacques de Thienne, Lord of Castres, to tell
the King of England that she had never believed the
report to be true. De Castres only started on his
mission in the middle of August, and the marriage
treaty had been signed since the 7th of the same
month, and Mary had married the prisoner
Duke of Longueville<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> by proxy at Greenwich on
the 13th.</p>

<p>This public ceremony at last convinced Margaret
of the unwelcome fact that her nephew had been
thrown over. She bitterly complained of King
Henry's want of good faith, and threatened to
publish the promise he had given in writing to
marry his sister to the Archduke Charles.</p>

<p>Before Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> married the eighteen-year-old
Mary Tudor he sent his first painter, Jean de Paris,
to London to paint her portrait and plan her
trousseau. Accompanied by King Henry, Queen
Katharine, and a great retinue of nobles as far
as Dover, the bride set sail for France, escorted by
the Duke of Suffolk. Amongst her ladies we find
the names of the Ladies Grey and Anne Boleyn.
Gorgeous pageants greeted Princess Mary; King
Louis went himself in state to receive her at Calais,
accompanied by the Duke of Valois and Margaret of
Angoulême, and loaded her with presents and costly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
jewels. The wedding took place at Abbeville on the
9th of October. With reference to this marriage,
Louise of Savoy, whose son, the Duke of Valois, was
heir-presumptive to the throne, made the following
spiteful entries in her diary: 'Le 22nd Septembre
1514, le roi Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>, fort antique et débile sortit
de Paris, pour aller au devant de sa jeune femme,
la reine Marie.'</p>

<p>'Le 9 Octobre 1514, furent les amoureuses noces
de Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>, roi de France, et de Marie d'Angleterre;
et furent épousés a dix heures du matin.'</p>

<p>On the 5th of November the new queen was
crowned at St. Denis, and during the ceremony
Francis, Duke of Valois, held the crown above her
head.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, in writing to thank Louis for a richly
caparisoned Spanish genet which he had sent as
a present, expressed his hopes that Mary's lively
disposition might not harm conjugal peace. But
Louis was quite fascinated by his youthful bride,
and for her sake changed all his habits, and breakfasted
at noon instead of eight in the morning, and
went to bed at midnight instead of six, and soon
ended by falling seriously ill. His wife amused him
whilst he lay in bed by singing romances to her
guitar; but three months after their marriage the
worn-out old king of fifty-two died during a terrific
storm which raged throughout New Year's night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
1515. Only a few faithful friends were with him at
the last, and when next day Mary was informed of
her loss she fainted, and with every sign of becoming
grief shut herself up according to the custom of royal
widows for six weeks in a darkened room.</p>

<p>Towards the month of March 1515 an English
embassy was sent to France, headed by the Duke
of Suffolk, to bring back the Queen-Dowager of
France to England. Margaret writes to her father:
'Monseigneur, I have received your three letters of
the 14th instant ... and in reply I write to inform
you that the King of England has despatched a
large embassy to the King of France, in charge of
the Duke of Suffolk, who I hear is sent to bring
back the Queen-Dowager.... As for the ambassadors
who are to go to England with the Bishop of
Brixen, I have communicated that part of your letters
to the lord of Chièvres, as head of the finances and
government of Monseigneur, who replied that the
various personages were ready, but that the difficulty
was finding money to provide them suitably. And
I think, Monseigneur, he speaks the truth,' but, she
adds sadly, 'I can do no more, for <i>now I do not
meddle</i> in any business.'</p>

<p>After this date Margaret's letters to her father
become much less frequent.</p>

<p>Soon after any dreams that she may have indulged
in of a fourth and handsome husband in the person
of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, were finally
dissipated by his marriage with the young Queen-Dowager
of France.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Mary Tudor was eighteen
years younger than Margaret, and was considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
one of the most beautiful princesses in Europe.
These facts may account for Charles Brandon's preference.
At any rate, after this episode Margaret
remained a widow to the end of her life, and although
the manuscripts in the British Museum abound with
her letters to Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, Wolsey, and others on
grave political affairs, they probably comprise no
more than those already quoted that have so direct
a reference to the affairs of her heart.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>CHARLES DECLARED OF AGE</h3>

<p class="p2">Soon after midnight on the 2nd of January
1515 Francis, Duke of Valois, was aroused
by an excited crowd rushing into his chamber
and hailing him King of France. 'May you have a
happy New Year!' cried his friend Fleurange, 'Les
belles étrennes!'</p>

<p>The new king was in his twenty-first year, and in
May 1514 had married Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>'s eldest daughter
Claude, thus securing Brittany to the French crown.
Young, brave, and handsome, with fascinating
manners, passionately fond of beauty in every form,
he was undoubtedly the most accomplished 'chevalier'
in the kingdom, but his love of pleasure and extravagance
were carried to excess, and marred the brilliancy
of his many good qualities. 'This big boy will spoil
everything,' Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> had predicted, more struck by
his son-in-law's failings than by his virtues.</p>

<p>On the 15th of February Francis made his state
entry into Paris, and at the banquet given the same
evening, the Flemish ambassadors were present,
having been previously received in audience by Queen
Claude. Mercurin de Gattinare wrote to Margaret
from Paris giving her an account of their reception.
'Queen Claude,' he says, 'is very small and extraordinarily
fat, but her graceful way of talking makes
amends for her lack of beauty.' When the ambassadors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
were presented to her, 'she kissed Monsieur de
Nassou, but gave her hand to Monsieur de Saint-Py
and all of us.'</p>

<p>Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> found his kingdom prepared for war.
From the time of his accession he dreamed of winning
glory in Italy, and reconquering the duchy of Milan.
As soon as he had made the necessary preparations
he entered on the campaign; and in August led a
brilliant army of 60,000 men and 30,000 horse across
the Alps by narrow, unfrequented roads over the Col
d'Argentière, entering Italy by the valley of the
Stura, thus avoiding the passes guarded by the
Swiss, and finally taking up a strong position to the
south-east of Milan, near Marignano. Against him
were the emperor, King Ferdinand, and the Swiss
Cantons, Venice being his only ally. Fifteen thousand
Venetians under Alviano advanced by forced marches
to help him, and had reached Lodi, four miles distant.
Milan itself was occupied by 30,000 Swiss, who were
resolved to prevent the junction of the two armies,
and attack the French in their own trenches. They
opened fire late on the afternoon of September 12th,
and all that evening until it grew pitch dark the
battle raged. When morning dawned the two armies
were still facing each other, and with the first rays
of the sun the battle continued with renewed vigour
until ten o'clock, when, at sight of the Venetian
advance-guard led by Alviano, the Swiss began to
waver, and hastily retreating to Milan, left the
French masters of the field.</p>

<p>Marshal Trivulzio, who had been present at
eighteen battles, declared that all the others were
child's play when compared to Marignano, which was
'a battle of giants.'</p>

<p>After the victory Francis wished to be knighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
by Bayard, who, though only a lieutenant, had so
distinguished himself that the whole army looked
upon him as a perfect model of a Christian soldier,
and gave him the name of 'le chevalier sans peur et
sans reproche.'</p>

<p>Maximilian, writing to Margaret from Innsbrück,
thus describes the battle of Marignano:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Very dear and much-loved daughter,&mdash;We have
had news that on the 13th of this month<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> (September),
the French being quartered about two leagues from
Germany, near Milan, they set out and appeared
before the said town. Wherefore the Swiss who
were in the town of Milan, having quitted the flat
country, being informed of this fact, left the town
about twenty thousand strong and marched against
the French, and about four o'clock in the afternoon
of the same day, the Swiss and French began to fight
each other, more by way of skirmishing than giving
battle, for there were so many ditches that the
French men-at-arms on horseback could not help
their foot-soldiers, and fought so long that night
surprised them; and all that night the said Swiss
and French remained on the field of battle, without
attacking each other until the morrow, the 14th of
the month, when they renewed the battle, which
lasted quite three hours, after which fight about three
thousand of the said landsknechts (foot-soldiers) and
as many or more Swiss were left dead upon the field.
And because there was mutiny and division amongst
the said Swiss, through some of their people making
peace with the French and refusing to fight, they
retreated some to Milan and others to Como, without
either party pursuing or trying to fight the other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
And because they could not subdue the mutiny, the
day after they left the above-mentioned places and
returned to their own country....'</p>


<p>After the battle Maximilian Sforza, Duke of Milan,
yielded his rights to the conqueror and accepted a
pension of 30,000 crowns.</p>

<p>Before the year was out, Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> and the Pope
met at Bologna and arranged a peace which was
signed at Fribourg and called 'La Paix perpétuelle.'</p>

<p>In the lull that followed the battle of Marignano
Maximilian found time to turn his attention to the
interesting occupation of planning marriages for his
grandchildren. His Court has been called a sort of
matrimonial agency, and his letters to Margaret
abound in projects and schemes for grand alliances
for his granddaughters. In the spring of 1515 he
had met the Kings of Poland and Hungary at
Vienna. Vladislav <span class="smcap">II.</span>, King of Hungary, had a son
Louis, whose marriage was now arranged with Mary
of Austria, whilst his daughter Anna was betrothed
to Ferdinand of Austria, Maximilian's youngest
grandson. It was hoped that this double marriage
would secure the kingdom of Hungary to the House
of Hapsburg, besides carrying out the original treaty
of 1463 between the Emperor Frederick <span class="smcap">III.</span> and King
Mathias.</p>

<p>In one of his letters to Margaret, Maximilian reminds
her of his remark that, in order to find a
husband for the 'Lady Léonora,' his eldest granddaughter,
he must wait for the decease of one of the
three principal queens of Europe, either of France,
England, or Poland. He now writes to say that the
Queen of Poland is dead, and it has been suggested
to him that the widowed king is thinking of Léonora,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and he would like to know his granddaughter's
wishes on the subject.</p>

<p>'As to our opinion,' he says, 'we are willing that
the said marriage should take place; for the said
King of Poland is a handsome person, somewhat fat,
anyhow he will never be fatter; with a white face
and body and very white hands, the height of Seigneur
de Berges at the age of twenty, with a handsomer
face than Monsieur de Berges has, for his face
is open and very honest.... He keeps great state,
is beloved by his subjects and by all those with whom
he comes in contact, of whom I am one, and also my
whole house. He is, as he told me with his own
mouth, which is beautiful and red, forty-six or
forty-seven years old, his hair is already a little
grey; his kingdom, two hundred miles from Germany,
large, warlike, and can raise a hundred
thousand fighting-men.... The king and all his
court speak German and Latin as well as their
native language....'</p>

<p>Margaret replied that in accordance with Maximilian's
wishes she had spoken to Léonora about the
projected marriage with the King of Poland. 'I
spoke to her,' she says, 'on my own account, telling
her of the virtues and beauty of the said king's
person, with the greatness of his kingdom, and all
that there was to be said on the subject; she listened
to me willingly, very gently, and rather timidly, and
after several subtle devices, I could only draw from
her the words that....' (Here the letter tantalisingly
breaks off.)</p>

<p>Sigismond <span class="smcap">I.</span>, King of Poland, of whom the emperor
draws so attractive a portrait, was in truth a
very accomplished prince&mdash;but he did not marry
Eleanor of Austria, and eventually became the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
husband of Bona, the daughter of Galeazzo Sforza,
Duke of Milan.</p>

<p>The Archduke Charles was now fifteen, and Maximilian
declared him of age and handed over to him
the reins of government of the Netherlands. He
was inaugurated Duke of Brabant in February 1515,
Count of Flanders in April, and successively took
possession of Holland and Zealand, Leeuward, Harlingen,
and Franicker. Charles's letter to the president
and councillors of Flanders announcing his
emancipation has been preserved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="p2">'<span class="smcap">Very dear and Well Beloved</span>,&mdash;It has pleased
the emperor, my lord and grandfather, to emancipate
us and free us from his guardianship and regency,
placing the government of our country and lordships ...
in our hands, and consenting that we be received
and sworn to the principality and lordship of the
same.... Therefore it is fit and reasonable that
all things which concern our rights, greatness, lordship,
and even the doing of justice and our other
affairs, should be conducted henceforth in our name
and under our title. For this cause we write to you;
we require and command that all letters, acts, and
other things which will be done and expedited towards
you for our aforesaid affairs, shall be drawn up
and despatched under our aforesaid name and title,
placing at the end of the letters: Given under the
seal which the emperor, my lord and grandfather, and
we have used during the time of our minority....</p>

<p class="right">'<span class="smcap">Charles</span> (1515)'</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">In addressing the deputies from the States-General
Charles made the following speech: 'Gentlemen, I
thank you for the honour and great affection you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
bear me. Be good and loyal subjects, and I will be
your good prince.'</p>

<p>Margaret does not appear to have been consulted
about Charles's emancipation until it was an accomplished
fact, and we can well understand that, accustomed
as she had been to exercise sovereign power
for eight years, she felt some secret anxiety in seeing
this power taken from her. Monsieur de Croy, Seigneur
de Chièvres, had always opposed the princess's
administration, and was anxious to exclude her from
the government; it was therefore an added blow to
know that he would now, as Charles's counsellor, be in
a position to deprive her of her nephew's confidence.</p>

<p>Margaret no longer presided at the State Council,
and was only appealed to as a matter of form. The
emperor's letters were not communicated to her, and
she even heard rumours that she was accused of personal
avarice and of having been unsuccessful in her
rule. She keenly resented these accusations and
complained to her father, and also addressed a
memorandum to her nephew containing a sketch of
her government, and accounts, with a full list of the
gifts and payments made out of her private income.</p>

<p>Maximilian replied that he has written to Charles,
and encloses a copy of the letter, in which he says:
'We make no doubt, because of the honour and love
you owe to our very dear daughter, your aunt, that
you communicate your chief and most arduous business
to her, and that you take and use her good advice
and counsel, from which, for natural reasons, you will
always find more comfort, help, and support than from
any other. In which, as a royal father, we exhort
you always to continue, begging you affectionately to
remember the way she laboured during your minority
in the administration of your country ... and also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
that you are her whole heart, hope, and heir,&mdash;that you
will give her a good allowance, such as she has had
until now ... for she has well deserved it from you.'</p>

<p>On August the 20th, 1515, Margaret presented a
memorandum to her nephew before the assembled
Council containing a justification of her government,
which began thus: 'Monseigneur, as I evidently
perceive, after having had such long patience, that
by divers means they try to give you suspicions of
me, your humble aunt, to withdraw me from your
goodwill and confidence, which would indeed be a
poor recompense for the services which I have rendered
you until now, I am constrained to excuse
myself....' She bitterly complains of the way
she has been put aside, and protests against the
calumnies brought against her. To justify her conduct,
she recalls her services during Charles's
minority, and firmly maintains that she always acted
uprightly and loyally without any profit to herself,
serving the prince from love, without any thought of
gain. If any error should be found in the detailed
account presented to the Council, she requests that
it may be pointed out to her before the prince, so
that she can answer it herself, for 'I prefer,' she
says, 'that they should speak before me, than behind
my back.' She then relates all the principal acts of
her government, from the time the emperor first
confided the regency to her care, and recalls her long
struggles with the Duke of Gueldres, who, aided and
abetted by the King of France, broke all treaties,
and feared neither God nor man; and recounts the
part she played in the alliance with England, and
also at the Treaty of Cambray, which was only
brought to a successful issue after much pain and
trouble. She indignantly denies that she has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
the cause of renewed wars with Gueldres, for far
from seeking war, she has ever striven for peace.
'And what has been the reward of all this service
and sacrifice?' From the time of her appointment
as regent she has given her time and money for her
nephew's service, without touching a 'denier,' and
spent more than three thousand florins from her own
income. The prince's proposed emancipation was
kept from her, though had her advice been asked she
would not have opposed it; her opinion was no
longer asked, and through calumnious imputations
it was tried to injure her with her nephew. The
payment of her pension was purposely delayed,
though every nobleman could count on receiving
the allowance due to him. 'If mine is larger,' she
adds, addressing herself to her nephew, 'I am also
your only aunt, and have no other son nor heir but
you, and I know of no one to whom your honour is
dearer than to me. You can rest assured, Monseigneur,
that when it pleases you to make use of my
services, and hold and treat me with the esteem
which is reasonable, I will serve you well and loyally,
not sparing my person or my goods, as I have done
heretofore. But if you are pleased to give ear to
what they tell you against me, and allow me to be
treated as I see they have begun to do, I would
much rather look after my own small affairs and
gracefully retire, as I have already begged the
emperor to allow me to do by my secretary, Marnix,
when he was lately with him.'</p>

<p>After the young prince had listened to this
eloquent justification, he declared, and the Chancellor
agreed, 'that Madame was held fully discharged
from all things, with many other fine words and promises.'
On the back of the paper is a note containing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the names of the councillors present when
Charles received the document, and at the end is a
full account of the money received at different times
from the Flemish States, and an appendix showing
the various gifts from Margaret's own collection of
treasures which she gave for the service of her
government during her regency.</p>

<p>Peace was once more restored, and we hear of
Margaret accompanying Charles at the various
festivities which marked his majority.</p>

<p>The following extract is from Margaret's memorandum
of gifts and sacrifices made by her during
regency:&mdash;</p>

<p>'1. To the Duke of Juliers, who had accompanied
her on her return from Germany, a large silver-gilt
goblet, weighing sixteen marks, which had been
given to her by the town of Antwerp.</p>

<p>'2. To the Controller of Calais, who had come on
an embassy from the King of England, half-a-dozen
cups, two jugs, and two flagons, all of silver, weighing
together fifty-five marks.</p>

<p>'3. To the English ambassadors who came to treat
about the marriage between her and the late King
Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, and who were afterwards sent to take
part in the Peace of Cambray, viz., to the Count of
Surrey a golden goblet out of which Madame drank
every day, weighing three hundred golden crowns;
to Richard Wingfield, second ambassador, twenty
yards of velvet, twenty yards of satin, and twenty
yards of damask; to the third ambassador ...
twenty yards of velvet and twenty yards of damask;
and to their herald, twenty yards of damask.</p>

<p>'4. To Monseigneur the Legate at the Treaty of
Cambray, by the advice of the Council, a very
beautiful golden goblet, weighing nearly six hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
crowns, with a cover ornamented with large
pearls, forming five trefoils of five pearls each, and
between each trefoil a very fine balass ruby, each of
the five table rubies valued at more than three hundred
and fifty golden florins. The foot of the goblet
had also five trefoils of medium-sized pearls and five
balass rubies.' In short, this cup, surmounted by
a great and beautiful emerald, was valued at more
than four thousand golden florins. The Cardinal
d'Amboise thought it so exquisite and beautiful
that he considered he ought to present it to King
Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span></p>

<p>'5. To the Bishop of Paris, being an ecclesiastic,
was given a beautiful and rich Book of Hours, which
had been bought from Maillardet for the sum of four
hundred golden crowns. It was ornamented with
gold; and on both covers were two superb table
diamonds, and to mark the place a large balass ruby,
set clear, which was valued at more than a thousand
florins, and to which were attached twenty-five silken
cords, each one finished with a pearl.</p>

<p>'6. To the Count of Carpi, two large and rich
silver flagons, which Madame had brought from
Spain, each weighing twenty-two marks, of good
workmanship.</p>

<p>'7. To the heralds, ushers, and other members of
the French embassy, from four to five hundred gold
crowns. "All given in order the better to nourish
peace and love between France and this House, as
the affairs of Monsieur require it." Other ambassadors,
officers, and gentlemen received various gifts
and presents to the amount of five thousand florins.</p>

<p>'Item.&mdash;Madame has lent her money for State
affairs, and has greatly reduced the expenses of her
own household.... For three years, far from having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
a pension for her services, she spent her dowry as
long as it lasted. It will also be found that during
her government she never gave any gratuities to her
dependants from the finances of Monsieur.'</p>

<p>This document, corrected in the margin by Margaret,
is found in duplicate in the archives of Lille.</p>

<hr class="c5" />

<p>Magnificent fêtes everywhere inaugurated Charles's
coming of age. The Pope presented him with the
Golden Rose; and Maximilian, writing to Margaret
on the 8th of December, hopes that she will see that
the Pope's ambassador, who brought the gift, is well
received by Charles, and orders that a sum of £700
be given to him.</p>

<p>M. Tailliar gives an interesting account of the
young archduke's state entry into Douay, accompanied
by Margaret: 'On the 15th of May 1516
Charles, King of Spain and Count of Flanders,
having made his joyous entry into Douay, went next
day, the 16th, to the market-hall to receive the
oaths of fealty. The square in front of the hall was
richly hung with velvet and cloth of gold. After
hearing mass, the king appeared, accompanied by
his aunt, Madame Margaret of Austria, and by his
eldest sister, Madame. He took the oath in the
prescribed manner, and likewise all those present
swore fealty to him.'</p>

<p>King Ferdinand of Aragon had died on the 23rd
of January 1516. By his will, Charles was excluded
from the kingdom of Aragon, which was left to his
younger brother, Ferdinand, who had been the old
king's favourite; but in his last moments, repenting
perhaps of this unjust arrangement, he made a codicil,
in which he not only left Charles heir to all his estates,
but also made him Grand Master of the Military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Orders, leaving Ferdinand with a pension of 50,000
ducats a year.</p>

<p>Although Queen Joanna was still alive, Charles
assumed the title of King, and was first proclaimed
Sovereign of Castile and Aragon, conjointly with his
mother, at Brussels, where Ferdinand's funeral obsequies
were celebrated in the cathedral of St. Gudule.
'Twice the king-at-arms of the Golden Fleece called
aloud, "Don Ferdinand." Twice the answer came,
"He is dead," and on this the great standard clattered
to the ground. Then cried the herald, "Long live
donna Jehanne and don Charles, by the grace of God
Catholic kings," whereon Charles, doffing his mourning,
received and brandished the sword of justice.'<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In Spain this assumption of the royal title was regarded
as a breach of custom, and caused comment
and discontent. Nevertheless Cardinal Ximenes had
his young master proclaimed in Castile. The regency
of Castile had been intrusted to him by Ferdinand
until Charles's arrival, and that of Aragon to the late
king's natural son, the Archbishop of Saragossa.</p>

<p>Before Charles succeeded to his Spanish kingdoms,
his sister Mary had already left home for her short,
though comparatively happy, marriage with the ill-fated
Louis of Hungary, while Isabella had begun
her miserable life with the brutal and licentious
Christian <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Denmark. His brother Ferdinand
and his youngest sister Katharine were being brought
up in Spain. Only Charles's eldest sister Eleanor
remained at Brussels. About this time she seems to
have had a rather serious flirtation with the handsome
Count Palatine Frederick, who was the most accomplished
nobleman of the Court, and though seventeen
years his senior, Charles's earliest personal friend. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
affection between the count and Eleanor was mutual,
and led to clandestine correspondence. Chièvres set
Charles on the track of one of the count's love-letters.
Pretending to wish his sister good-morning, he
snatched it from her bosom before she had time to
read it, and after a brief scrimmage secured the prize.
'Upon this his constancy into a like affair,' wrote
Spinelli to Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, 'many do conject in him good
stomak and couraggy, and how he will be fast in
his determjnacions, and much extime the honnor of
the worlde.' This singularly sound forecast of the
character of the hitherto problematic boy of sixteen
gives, perhaps, the first glimpse of his personality.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Educated by the courtly William de Croy, Lord
of Chièvres, with Adrian of Utrecht as preceptor,
Charles developed manners and characteristics, half
patrician, half plebeian, which was probably due to
his tutors' opposite influences. De Croy's courteous
manners gave him a stately bearing, reserve, and
dignity which subsequently attached him to the
Spaniards; while from Adrian he acquired the
popular, easy-going and simple ways which made
him so beloved by his Flemish subjects.</p>

<a href="images/illus207_b.jpg">View larger image</a></p>

<p>His intellectual faculties did not develop early&mdash;he
even showed marked aversion for science and letters,
and preferred military exercises to the study of
government. De Chièvres, however, made him study
the history not only of his own kingdoms, but of
those with which they were connected. He accustomed
him, from the time of his assuming the government
of Flanders, to attend to business, and persuaded him
to read all papers relating to public affairs, to be
present at the deliberations of his privy-councillors,
and to propose to them himself those matters concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
which he required their opinion. From such
an education Charles contracted habits of gravity
and recollection which scarcely suited his youth. The
first openings of his genius did not show that superiority
which its maturer age displayed.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The French envoy once expressed surprise at
Charles's diligence before De Chièvres, who replied:
'My friend, I am his tutor and master. When I die,
I want him to be free, for if he does not understand
his own affairs, after my death he will be obliged
to have another tutor, and will always have to lean
on others.'</p>

<p>Charles did not hurry at once to enter into his new
possessions. He remained in Flanders until the repeated
entreaties of Ximenes, and the advice of his
grandfather, Maximilian, at last prevailed on him to
embark for Spain. Before he set out he confirmed
Margaret in the government of the Netherlands, and
appointed a Council to assist her. Accompanied by
his sister Eleanor, De Chièvres, his Prime Minister,
and a splendid train of Flemish nobles, he set sail
from Flushing on September the 8th, and after a
dangerous voyage, landed at Villa Viciosa, in the province
of Asturias. For six weeks Charles wandered
through the wild mountainous country without entering
any large town. On the last day of October the
Constable of Castile met him, and soon the Spanish
nobility flocked to greet their sovereign from all
parts of the kingdom. But before Charles would
show himself to his people he visited his mother and
his youngest sister Katharine at Tordesillas. Queen
Joanna was surprised to find Charles and Eleanor
grown up, and asked if they were really her children.
A little later Charles tried to remove his young sister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Katharine from her gloomy surroundings, but her
secret abstraction caused her mother such grief that
she had to be restored.</p>

<p>About this time Maximilian wrote to Margaret,
sending advice to Charles, and begging her to continue
to help him: 'My good daughter, thinking day and
night about the affairs of my heirs, I have decided,
chiefly for the good and honour of my son, King
Charles, to write to my deputies who are with him,
certain things concerning their good and that of their
subjects. Knowing that you will be required by my
said son to accomplish an honourable charge, we
desire and we require that you should fulfil it; in so
doing you will do a thing very pleasant and honourable
to yourself, as you will more clearly understand
from our deputies, Messieurs André de Burgo and
Nycasy. And so 'A. Diu.' Written on the 2nd of
March by the hand of your good and loyal father,
<span class="smcap">Maxi</span>.'</p>

<p>Charles's arrival in Spain caused great excitement
among high and low, and every one was speculating
about his appearance, character, and accomplishments.
The Bishop of Badajoz sent the following interesting,
though somewhat exaggerated, description of the new
king and his surroundings to Cardinal Ximenes: 'The
prince,' he says, 'has good parts, but he has been
kept too much isolated from the world, and, in particular,
he knows too little of Spaniards. He does
not understand a single word of Spanish. He obeys
his councillors implicitly; but, as he has entered the
seventeenth year of his age, it would be well if he
took part in the discussions of his Council.</p>

<p>'Monsieur de Chièvres is the most influential person
in the prince's Court; he is prudent and gentle,
but avaricious. The same may be said of the Chancellor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
of Burgundy. On the whole, love of money is
the besetting sin of the Flemings. They buy and sell
the Government offices, and it is to be feared that they
will introduce the same custom into Spain....
Monsieur de Chièvres is a Frenchman by birth, and
keeps the prince very much under subjection to the
King of France. The prince signs his letters to the
King of France, "Your humble servant and vassal,"
... and though he signs himself to others "Principe,"
he likes to be called king....'</p>

<p>Cardinal Ximenes' health was now rapidly declining.
When the news of Charles's arrival in Spain had been
brought to him he revived a little, and sent the young
king letters of welcome, filled with good advice as to
the best way of securing his people's affection. Charles
answered in the most deferential manner, but his
Belgian Ministers, fearing that the Cardinal would
exercise too much influence over him, prevented their
meeting by keeping the king in the north, and
estranging him from Ximenes. Through their advice
Charles wrote to the Cardinal in a very different strain,
depriving him not only of the regency but of all share
in state affairs. When the letter was brought to
Ximenes at Roa he was dangerously ill. Adrian de
Burgo was with him, but feared to tell him of the
royal command, and the great Cardinal, who had preserved
the kingdom of Castile intact for his master,
passed away without the knowledge of Charles's ingratitude.
He died on the 8th of November 1517 in
the eighty-third year of his age.</p>

<p>De Chièvres had now no rival, and hoped to be as
powerful in Spain as he was in the Netherlands.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>DEATH OF MAXIMILIAN</h3>

<p class="p2">On the 18th of November 1517, ten days after
Ximenes' death, Charles, accompanied by a
gorgeous train of nobles, ambassadors, and
the flower of the Spanish army, made his state entry
into Valladolid, the capital of Old Castile. The
splendid procession slowly wound its way through
the narrow streets of the town. First came thirty
falconers, with birds on wrist, some wearing the
king's livery of white, yellow, and red, others the red
and green of Ferdinand, then two hundred of the
royal guard, a contingent of Spanish Lancers, with
the nobles' drum and fife bands, followed by twenty
led chargers from the king's stables. Behind rode
three hundred Spanish and Flemish nobles, then two
hundred men-at-arms, with foreign ambassadors and
heralds; and lastly Charles appeared, a truly regal
figure in surcoat of crimson silk and gold brocade
over his steel armour, seated on a prancing horse,
'with the majority of its legs always in the air,' but,
as an eye-witness observed, the king no more stirred
nor swayed than if he had been glued thereon.'<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Fêtes and tournaments followed, and the people
flocked from far and near to see their king; but
beneath the rejoicings there were murmurs and discontent,
for the chief posts were given to Flemings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
to the exclusion of Spaniards, who naturally felt
themselves slighted, and the clergy, to show their
annoyance, rudely refused to quarter the royal suite.
Jean le Sauvage, Grand Chancellor of Burgundy,
was made Chancellor of Castile, and to De Chièvres'
young nephew, a mere boy, was given the archbishopric
of Toledo, the wealthiest see in Spain.</p>

<p>Amidst general discontent the Cortes opened on
February 2nd, 1518. The town deputies began by
objecting to the new Chancellor presiding over their
first meeting. After some stormy debates, the oath
of allegiance was taken to Charles and his mother
conjointly, but it was appointed that Joanna's name
should be placed before that of her son in all public
acts. A generous subsidy of six hundred thousand
ducats was voted for three years. Charles was
petitioned to marry at once, and to keep his brother
in Spain until there was a direct heir to the throne.
To these requests he gave evasive answers, but when
implored to learn Spanish, he replied that he had
already begun to study the language. As a matter
of fact he only knew a few words, and his answers
were extremely abrupt and hesitating. An Italian
envoy who was present remarked: 'He says little,
is not of much ability, and is entirely ruled by his
Flemish governors'; whilst the Marquis of Pescara,
who became one of his greatest generals, reported
that in three audiences he had not said three words.
But the young monarch was only biding his time,
and was soon to prove that he was not such a cipher
as he allowed himself to appear.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>When Charles became king, his Ministers were
anxious to bring about a reaction against Maximilian
and Margaret's hostile attitude towards France, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
for this end Charles hastened to inform Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> of
his accession. The French king replied by sending
the Sire de la Roche with his affectionate congratulations,
and expressed the hope that their friendship
would become still closer. In an enthusiastic letter
to Francis, Charles said: 'Monseigneur, in order to
continue the fervent love I bear you, I wished as a
good son to a good father, to inform you of my
prosperous accession here, which is such, that in
giving thanks to our Creator, who directs all things,
yesterday, after mass was solemnly celebrated in the
temple of our said Creator, accompanied by many
ambassadors, yours amongst them, I was splendidly
well received, and unanimously acknowledged lord
and king of these my realms of Castile, Leon,
Granada, and their dependencies, by the prelates,
nobles, and representatives of the said kingdoms, with
such great reverence and goodwill that ... nothing
could be better....'<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> But Charles had a long progress
in front of him, and soon after left Castile and
set out for Saragossa, the capital of Aragon, in order
to attend the Cortes of that kingdom. On his way
there he took leave of his brother Ferdinand, whom
he sent to Germany on the pretext of visiting Maximilian.
This prudent but unpopular man&oelig;uvre
probably saved Charles his Spanish dominions, for in
the struggle that followed with the Cortes of Aragon
the Spaniards would willingly have offered the crown
to the younger brother, who had been brought up
amongst them, and who was a favourite with all
the people.</p>

<p>All this time Margaret was anxiously following
every movement of her beloved nephew, and was
kept well informed of his reception and progress.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
In one of her letters to Maximilian she says:
'Yesterday I received letters from the king, my lord
and nephew, who is very well, and behaves himself
so wisely and discreetly, that it is to his great honour
and profit. He is, I understand, thinking of sending
his brother over here about the month of April,
which I much desire.'</p>

<p>On July the 24th, 1518, Charles issued an edict
from Saragossa authorising his aunt to sign all
documents in his name, giving her full power as though
she was ruler, and causing the following announcement
to be published in the Netherlands:&mdash;'By our
letters-patent given in our town of Saragossa, on the
24th day of July last, and for the things contained
therein, we have ordained that our very dear Lady
and Aunt, the Lady Margaret, Archduchess of
Austria, Dowager of Savoy, etc., shall sign from
henceforth all letters, acts, and documents with her
own hand, which are issued for us, and for our
business over there, which ought to be sealed with
our seal. Signing with these words: 'Par le Roy.
Marguerite'; that she shall have the care of the seal
of our finances, and that she <i>alone</i> shall provide and
dispose of the appointments of this our country, for
we have given and left the disposal of them to her,
assisted by the chief and other members of our privy
council....'<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Maximilian was delighted when he heard of
Charles's renewed confidence in his aunt, and wrote
to Margaret expressing his pleasure in the following
letter, which was one of the last he was destined to
write to her:&mdash;'Very dear and much-beloved daughter,
we have received your letters of the 25th of
October, and hear through them of the honour and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
authority that our good son, the Catholic king, has
lately bestowed upon you, which gives us great
pleasure, and we have good hope that you will so
acquit yourself to the wellbeing, guidance, and direction
of his affairs, that he may not only have cause
to be pleased, but as your good nephew he will
increase your said authority more and more. In
doing which he could do nothing more pleasing
to us. This God knows, and may He, very dear
and much-beloved daughter, have you in His keeping.
Written from our town of Wels, the 12th day
of December, in the year 1518. Your good father,
<span class="smcap">Maxi</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>This same year Margaret's eldest niece, Eleanor,
was married to Emmanuel, King of Portugal, who
had previously married first Isabel and then Maria,
both daughters of Ferdinand and Isabella. Her
elderly husband did not long survive his third marriage,
but died in 1523, and was succeeded by John <span class="smcap">III.</span>,
who, in the following year, married Eleanor's youngest
sister, Katharine.</p>

<p>Since the summer Maximilian's health had
gradually been declining. In July he presided for
the last time at the Diet of Augsburg, and earnestly
pressed for the fulfilment of his two dearest wishes&mdash;the
fitting out of a crusade against the Turks, and
the elector's promise to secure the succession to the
imperial crown for his grandson, Charles. To this
latter request there existed the obstacle, that as he
himself had never been crowned by the Pope, he
was only regarded by the Roman See as King of
the Romans, and therefore Charles could not be invested
with that dignity. Maximilian, however,
spared no means to gain his ends, and bribed heavily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
wherever he thought it advisable. Charles appears
to have objected to the exorbitant price that was put
upon the imperial crown, knowing well that he
would one day have to raise the promised sums from
his resources in Spain, but his grandfather and
Margaret, with their councillors, overruled his objections,
and strongly advised him not to bargain for
fear of the French king profiting by his stinginess.
In an enigmatical letter Margaret thus expresses
herself:&mdash;'The Lord King, my nephew, has written
to us that the horse on which he wishes to come
and see us is very dear. We know well that it is
dear; but as matters stand, if he does not wish to
have it, there is a buyer ready to take it, and, since
he has broken it in, it seems a pity that he should
give it up, whatever it costs him.'<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Whilst Maximilian
was engaged in taking measures to obtain
his desires, the elector's attention was fully occupied
by formidable religious troubles. The monk, Martin
Luther, had arisen and vehemently declaimed against
certain practices of the Church of Rome, and a spirit
of revolt and restlessness was in the air. Maximilian
does not appear to have been greatly interested in
the commencement of the Reformation. Although
in his letters to Margaret he often satirically complained
of 'les beaux pratikes de la sainte mère de
l'Église,' still he was far from upholding any schism
in the Church, and urged on by the solicitations of
the monks, he wrote to Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span> asking him to
determine the religious disputes by his decision, and
summoned Luther to appear with a safe conduct
before the Diet of Augsburg to answer for his attack
on the system of Indulgences. Luther arrived too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
late for the Assembly, and the emperor never saw
him, but at the subsequent interview that took place
before the Cardinal Legate the monk was told he
must either recant his heresies or depart. He refused
to recant, and departed to Wittenberg, there to write
and publish an account of his interview, which was
read far and wide, and helped to further the spirit of
schism and revolt.</p>

<p>After a summer spent at Innsbrück, where he was
attacked by an intermittent fever, the emperor
travelled to Wels, in Upper Austria, hoping that the
pure country air would restore his health. But the
fever continued, aggravated, it is said, by too violent
exercise, and an imprudent indulgence in melons.
Soon dysentery supervened, and on the 12th of
January 1519 he passed away in the sixtieth year of
his age.</p>

<p>As long as he had been able to do so, Maximilian
bravely attended to public business, but racked with
fever at night, and unable to sleep, he tried to soothe
his weariness by having the history of the House of
Austria and legends of the saints related to his house
read aloud to him. Feeling that his end was near,
he asked for a Carthusian monk from Brisgau.
When the monk entered his room the emperor sat
up and received him with every sign of joy, and
turning to the officers standing round his bed he
said: 'This is the man who will show me the way
to heaven.' With an untroubled mind, and every
semblance of piety, he received the last sacraments,
and gave minute directions as to his burial, which he
wished to be as simple as possible. To show the
emptiness of human greatness he ordered that after
death his teeth should be drawn, his body polled and
shaved (<i>rasé et épilé</i>), and exposed for a whole day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
then enclosed in a sack of quicklime and placed in a
coffin which he had carried about with him since
1515, and buried in the church of the castle of
Nieustad under the altar dedicated to Saint George,
in such a position that his head should be under the
feet of the celebrant. His heart he wished to be buried
at Bruges, near his first wife, Mary of Burgundy,
'sa réelle épouse.' Having thus made all arrangements,
he took leave of those present, raising his hand
and giving them his blessing. 'Why do you weep,'
he asked, 'because you see in me a mortal? Such
tears suit women better than men.' And thus
calmly and fearlessly Maximilian faced death, reverently
responding to the monk's prayers until his
voice failed; but when he could no longer utter,
still showed by signs that he followed the holy
office, until sinking into unconsciousness, with a
smile upon his face, he passed away before the
dawn.</p>

<p>Maximilian was twice married; first, to Mary of
Burgundy, through whom he became possessed of the
vast domains of that house; and secondly, to Bianca
Sforza, daughter of the Duke of Milan, by whom he
had no children. Of a kindly and chivalrous nature
and endowed with many good qualities, Maximilian
was popular amongst his subjects, but obtained little
esteem from his contemporaries, owing to a radical
inconstancy and indecision of temper, and an extravagance
which involved him in perpetual pecuniary
embarrassments. Margaret was not present at her
father's death, but no one felt his loss more keenly
than she did, for he had ever shown himself an
affectionate and devoted parent, and though so often
parted, their intercourse had been, as their correspondence
proves, of the closest and most intimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
kind. Her grief found vent in a long poem or lament,
in which she enumerates her many sorrows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'.... O mort trop oultrageuse!</p>
<p>Tu a estain la fleur chevaleureuse</p>
<p>Et as vaincu celluy qui fust vainqueur,</p>
<p>Maximilien, ce très-noble Empereur,</p>
<p>Qui en bonté à nul ne se compère.</p>
<p>C'estoy César, mon seul seigneur et père,</p>
<p>Mais tu l'as mis en trop piteux estat,</p>
<p>Sépulturé au chasteau Nieustat....'<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>Amongst the condolences which she received there
is an interesting joint-letter in Latin from Anne of
Hungary (who was betrothed to Ferdinand of
Austria), and from Ferdinand's sister Mary (affianced
to Louis of Hungary). The letter is written from
Innsbrück on the 22nd of January and signed by both
princesses.</p>

<p>Maximilian did much to improve his country, and
greatly encouraged art and learning. He especially
favoured the universities of Vienna and Ingoldstadt,
and caused at least two works to be written under his
own personal direction&mdash;<i>Theuerdank</i> in verse, and
<i>Weiss Künig</i> in prose&mdash;in both of which he figures as
the hero. He also rendered an important service to
Germany by abolishing the famous secret tribunal of
Westphalia.</p>

<p>Charles was on his way to Barcelona when he
received the news of his grandfather's death. Deputing
Adrian of Utrecht to hold the Cortes of
Valencia, he hurried from Barcelona to Corunna on
the Galician coast, intending to set sail for his new
kingdom. His appointment of Adrian as sole regent
was the crowning insult to Spanish feelings; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Cardinal had little experience and less ability; above
all he was of low birth and a foreigner, and the king
had promised to bestow no office on 'those who were
not natives of the kingdom.' Besides, a Cortes had
been summoned to meet at Santiago in Galicia, outside
Castile, and the Castilians felt deeply injured.
Discontent was rife on all sides, and many wild
rumours were afloat. It availed little that Charles
in his broken Spanish promised to return in three
years. The deputies were not mollified, and demurred
to granting the desired subsidy, which was only reluctantly
voted. Charles excused his hurried departure
from Spain on the plea of his obligation to
attend to his new dominions, but this excuse did not
pacify his discontented subjects, who foresaw the
misery of his prolonged absence, with a hated foreigner
as regent.</p>

<p>Maximilian's death revived Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>'s hopes of
gaining the much-coveted imperial crown, for he was
not long in recognising the equivocal and expectant
attitude of the electors who had formally promised
their votes to the dead emperor. He now entered
the lists as Charles's rival, and tried to gain over the
electors by every means in his power.</p>

<p>Margaret was in despair at the apparent small
chance of her nephew's success, and with the advice
of her Council prepared to send the Archduke Ferdinand
into Germany to look after his brother's interests,
and suggested that Charles should waive his
claim in favour of Ferdinand, whose candidature
would be less likely to be opposed by the Pope and
the German princes.</p>

<p>But Charles was as adamant, and indignantly rejected
this proposal, asserting that it had been his
grandfather's wish that he alone should succeed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the imperial dignities, and for this end the electors
had promised him their votes. If Ferdinand was
chosen, the empire would be weakened, and the
House of Austria divided, to the gratification of his
enemies. 'He alone,' he haughtily said, 'ought to
be emperor in order to uphold the splendour of his
House, and realise the great designs he had conceived
for the good of Christianity. Should our person
be elected, as is reasonable from what has gone
before, we could carry out many good and great plans,
and not only preserve and keep the dominions that
God has given us, but greatly increase them, by
giving peace, repose, and tranquillity to all Christendom,
in exalting and upholding our holy Catholic
faith which is our chief foundation....'<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Margaret hastened to justify her conduct in a letter
to Charles on the 21st of March, in which she said
that when the news of Maximilian's illness reached
the Netherlands, the Council had judged it wiser to
send Ferdinand to Germany to watch over Charles's
hereditary domains, but that the archduke would
yield to his brother's wishes, 'for,' she added, 'one
could not see a better or more debonair prince of his
age.'</p>

<p>As matters turned out, Charles's determination was
fully justified, for Francis's methods had not proved
successful, and had only alienated him from some of
his most powerful supporters. The condottiere, Franz
von Sickingen, the Duke of Bouillon, and his brother
Érard de la Marck, Bishop of Liége, offended by
Francis's treatment of them, went over to the Court
of Brussels and upheld the interest of the Spanish
king.</p>

<p>The rivalry which from henceforth existed between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the two young monarchs promised ere long to break
the friendly relations with which Charles's reign began,
but Margaret with her usual diplomacy saw the
danger of a rupture with France at such a moment,
and strongly advised Charles to keep on good terms
with his rival. Acting on this wise advice, when
Robert de la Marck left France and joined the Court
at Brussels, Charles's ambassadors hastened to assure
the French king that their master had taken no part
in Robert's defalcation, and to support their assertion
proposed that Charles should marry Francis's youngest
daughter, Princess Charlotte, which offer was very
well received.</p>

<p>To get an idea of the activity and political talents
Margaret displayed in connection with Charles's election
one must read her correspondence with Frederick,
Count Palatine, Maximilian de Berghes, Henry of
Nassau, her treasurer Marnix, the Cardinals of Sion
and Gurce, John de la Saulx, and Gérard de Pleine,
and glance through her accounts and receipts, which
show what enormous sums were spent in presents,
bribes, pensions, and salaries on all those who were
likely to contribute to the desired end. The Archbishops
of Cologne, Mayence, and Trèves, and their
councillors received between them nearly five hundred
florins in gold. In these curious accounts large sums
appeared to have been lavished not only on the principal
negotiators, but on their relations, friends, and
servants. Thus five hundred florins are given to the
Archbishop of Trèves' nephew, a hundred to the
Cardinal of Mayence's valet-de-chambre, and a present
of two thousand florins is promised to Count
John, the elector of Cologne's brother, who is supposed
to have more influence than the elector himself.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Margaret also drew largely from her own revenues
in furthering her nephew's interests, and transferred
to him the duchies and lordships she had inherited
from Maximilian. In grateful appreciation Charles
presented her with the town and territory of Malines
for her life and a sum of two hundred thousand golden
florins (the deed being signed on September the 18th,
1520, at Brussels). In a long letter written from
Barcelona, on the 22nd of February 1519, he thanks
her warmly for all the trouble she has taken with
regard to his election, recommending her to spare
no means to obtain the desired end. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Pope at first warmly upheld Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>'s claim
and opposed his rival, but he soon saw that the
French king had small chance of success, whilst all
seemed in favour of Charles. Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span> did not dissemble
that he would have preferred a less powerful
emperor than either the King of Castile or the
King of France&mdash;'but,' as Charles confidently wrote
to his envoys in Germany, 'if it should come to
choosing either of us two, he has given out that he
would be better pleased with us than with the said
King of France, and would not refuse us the said
dispensation nor any other thing that we should
ask.'<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Although things seemed to be in his favour, still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
the King of Spain's election was far from a certainty.
Henry of Nassau, writing to Margaret, did not
conceal the difficulties that had to be overcome.
'The king,' he says, 'is little known in Germany;
the French have said much against him, and the
Germans, who come from Spain, have hardly said
any good.'</p>

<p>Whilst the struggle between the rival kings' agents
continued, the kings themselves were no less anxious
as to the final issue. Charles was certain that if
the imperial crown left the House of Austria the
French would lay claim to his hereditary German
states as well as to his kingdom of Naples; and
besides being forced to renounce for ever the recovery
of the duchy of Burgundy, he might even run the
risk of being despoiled of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the possible election of Charles
filled Francis with dismay. On the 16th of April
1519 he wrote to his ambassadors in Germany: 'You
understand the reason that moves me to acquire
the empire and prevent the Catholic king from
acquiring it. If he gets it, seeing the greatness of
the kingdoms and lordships he possesses, he might,
in time, do me inestimable harm. I should always
be uneasy and mistrustful, and it is to be feared that
he would take good care to drive me out of Italy.'</p>

<p>But at last the long struggle came to an end, the
Pope withdrew his opposition, and Margaret was
rewarded by Charles's election at Frankfort as King
of the Romans on June 28th, 1519, five months and
ten days after Maximilian's death. The news of his
election was conveyed in nine days from Frankfort
to Barcelona, where Charles was detained by the
Catalonian Cortes. His coronation, which gave him
the title of 'Romanorum Imperator,' did not take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
place until the following year. The title of Emperor,
though carrying with it no possessions, gave him
the position of 'first of earthly potentates in dignity
and rank.'</p>

<p>Louise of Savoy bitterly alludes to her son's
successful rival in her diary. 'En Juillet, Charles
Ve de ce nom, fils de Philippe, archiduc d'Autriche,
fut, après que l'Empire eut esté vacant par l'espace
de cinq mois, éleu roy des Romains en la ville de
Francfort. Pleut à Dieu qu'il eust plus longuement
vacquée, ou bien que pour jamais on l'eust laissé
entre les mains de Jhésus-Christ, auquel il appartient
et non à d'autres.'<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Public rejoicings and processions
gave expression to the Netherlanders' joy at this
great event, and the States enthusiastically voted
200,000 crowns for the expenses of the forthcoming
coronation. On the 30th of June Margaret informed
the governors of the provinces of Charles's election,
and at the same time ordered the towns and villages
to give thanks to God 'by processions, sermons, pious
prayers and orisons,' and to have 'fireworks, rejoicings,
and other festivities which were suitable and
usual in such a case.' In her letter to the Governor
of Lille she triumphantly says: 'We have, this hour,
received letters from the ambassadors of the king,
my lord and nephew, who are now in Germany, in
which they inform us that ... MM. the electors
of the Holy Empire have unanimously, through the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit ... elected my said
lord and nephew King of the Romans.... We
command you ... to inform his good subjects ...
requesting them to praise and render thanks to God
our Creator, by processions, sermons, devout prayers
and orisons.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Margaret's instructions were well carried out, and
the festivities lasted a month until the end of July.</p>

<p>But Charles was badly needed in Flanders, for
the four years' truce with Charles of Gueldres
had expired, and the Guelderlanders were again
giving trouble. Margaret's hands were full, and
she anxiously awaited her nephew's arrival. After
having handed over the government to Adrian of
Utrecht, he left Barcelona on the 20th of January,
and disregarding the murmurs of his Spanish subjects,
who were smarting under the insult of a Castilian
Cortes being summoned to meet at Santiago, passed
through Burgos, Valladolid, and Gallicia to the port
of Corunna.</p>

<p>He set sail towards the end of May and steered a
straight course for England, intending to pay a visit
to Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and his aunt, Queen Katharine. A
negotiation had for some time been secretly carried
on between Cardinal Wolsey and the Court of Spain,
and this visit was not as sudden as it appeared. In
the previous March Charles had sent envoys to
England to propose a friendly visit during his
intended journey from Spain to Flanders. In a
letter written to Charles by his ambassadors from
London on the 19th of March 1520 we learn that
King Henry sent for them to Greenwich on the
previous day, which was a Sunday, and after mass
took them aside, Cardinal Wolsey and Queen Katharine
being present, and told them that he was very
glad that things had turned out as they had done,
and addressing Queen Katharine said, that when the
emperor, his brother, and her nephew should arrive,
he hoped to see him before meeting his brother of
France.... That he had written to the French
king to postpone seeing him until later, but had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
taken care not to give any reason for so doing. He
hoped he would receive a favourable reply, for he
thought it hardly possible that the King of France
had heard of the emperor's intended visit to England,
for when he heard of it he would not be pleased, and
for this reason things were to be kept as secret as
possible. 'The queen then raised her eyes to heaven
and praised God for the hope she had for the fulfilment
of her dearest wish, which was to see your
Majesty, and humbly thanked her lord the king,
making him a very low curtsey, and the said lord
king took off his cap and said to her, "We on our
side will do all that we can...."'<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>With every precaution of secrecy a treaty was
signed on the 11th of April minutely arranging the
reception of Charles by Henry and Katharine,
either at Sandwich on his way to the Netherlands,
or at a subsequent meeting between Calais and
Gravelines.</p>

<p>It was towards the end of May when news was
brought to Henry at Canterbury that the emperor's
fleet had been sighted off Plymouth, and was sailing
up the Channel. Wolsey was sent off at once to
greet Charles with a Latin speech and invite him to
land. Surrounded by his suite and a goodly retinue,
Charles landed at Dover on May 26th, and was conducted
to the castle, where, early on the following
morning, Henry arrived and warmly welcomed his
nephew. Amidst cheering crowds, who wondered
at the simplicity of the Spanish king's dress and
following, the two monarchs rode together to Canterbury,
where Queen Katharine impatiently awaited
her sister's son. By her side was her little daughter,
Mary Tudor, a fair-haired child of four, with big
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
brown eyes, and near her stood the elder Mary
Tudor, the beautiful Duchess of Suffolk, former
Queen of France. Charles stayed four days feasting
at Canterbury, during which time he cleverly
managed to attach Wolsey more closely to his
interests by whispering promises of future assistance
when the papal throne should become vacant, and
deeply impressing the English king by his mature
judgment, deference, and courtesy. It was agreed
that the two sovereigns should shortly meet again
between Calais and Gravelines, and that Henry
should be accompanied by Katharine and Charles
by Margaret. And so, with many expressions of
goodwill on all sides, Charles set sail from Sandwich
for Flanders on the same day that Henry embarked
at Dover for Calais on his way to meet Francis
between Ardres and Guisnes at the memorable scene
of splendour and display known as 'the Field of the
Cloth of Gold.'<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>On the 1st of June Charles landed at Flushing
at four o'clock in the afternoon, and continued his
journey to Bruges, where he was warmly welcomed
by Margaret and his brother Ferdinand, surrounded
by the chief Flemish nobles, ambassadors from
Venice, and deputies from the principal German
towns.</p>

<p>Charles was now in his twenty-first year. Of
middle height, with well-proportioned limbs, a pale
sallow complexion, light blue eyes, aquiline nose,
and a protruding lower jaw, his expression, though
heavy, was at once dignified and reserved; no trace
of passing emotion disturbed the serenity of his
features. His broad forehead and penetrating glance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
gave strength to his expression, and his gentle
courtesy and charm of manner won him the affection
of all those who had to serve him. An interesting
insight into his character is given in a letter from
Gérard de Pleine to Margaret:&mdash;'There is no one
great enough or wise enough in his kingdom to
make him change his opinion, if he does not see a
reason for changing it. I have known many princes
at different times, but none who have taken greater
pains to understand their affairs, or who disposed of
them more absolutely than he does. He is his own
treasurer of finance and his own treasurer of war;
he bestows offices, bishoprics, appointments as God
inspires him, without listening to the prayers of
any.'</p>

<p>A little later, Aleander, whom Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span> sent to persuade
Charles to condemn Luther, gives an interesting
estimate of the emperor's character. Aleander
was a man of the world and a scholar, and though
well aware of the faults of the Church and the folly
of the Papacy, was eager to extirpate what he
believed to be the seeds of social and ecclesiastical
anarchy. On being granted an audience he addressed
the emperor in French; Charles replied by declaring
his willingness to risk his life in defence of the
Church and the Holy See. He spoke at some
length, but so extremely well that Aleander was
much impressed by his ability, and wrote admiringly,
'Say what they will, this prince seemed to me well
endowed with sense and with prudence, far beyond
his years; to have much more, however, at the
back of his head than he carries on his face.'<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Charles had asked his aunt to convoke the States-General,
and he found them assembled when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
arrived at Brussels. In a long speech he praised
Margaret's wise administration, loyalty and devotion,
and thanked her Council for the help they had
given. He repeated that, in spite of his absence,
'his heart had always been with them.' He then
gave a summary of his sojourn in Spain, and informed
the States that he had returned to take possession
of the imperial crown, as well as the domains he had
inherited in Germany, but that he was badly in need
of funds, and asked them to do their best to help him.</p>

<p>The meeting of the Field of the Cloth of Gold,
where Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> tried by every means in his power
to ingratiate himself with the English king, was
hardly over when Charles started for Gravelines to
try and efface the impression produced by his rival.
Gravelines was a small place, ill-fitted for the reception
of kings, but Charles had different methods
than those employed by Francis, and he succeeded
in confirming himself in his uncle's good graces by
showing him the most courteous deference, and
flattering his vanity in offering that he should act
as arbitrator in any differences which might arise
between Spain and France. Henry and Francis had
already signed a treaty on the 6th of June whereby
it was settled that the Dauphin should marry the
Princess Mary; but on the 14th of July another
treaty was secretly arranged in which the French
alliance was indefinitely postponed, and Charles's
marriage with Mary agreed upon, although at the
time he was pledged to marry the French Princess
Charlotte. Wolsey was largely responsible for this
change in affairs, for he was now bidding high for
the emperor's favour, though outwardly he still kept
on good terms with Francis.</p>

<p>The Chronicle of Calais gives an interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
account of Henry's meeting with Charles at Gravelines
on the 10th of July 1520. Margaret accompanied
her nephew, and together, with a brilliant
following of lords and ladies, the two monarchs and
the regent journeyed to Calais. Within the town a
large tent had been erected intended for a banqueting-hall,
the seats arranged in tiers and draped with
rich tapestries. The roof painted to represent the
sky with sun, moon, stars, and clouds; but a great
storm of wind and rain arose, and during the night
the great tent, with all its fine decorations and
tapestries, was blown down and ruined.</p>

<p>The two kings spent four days together, first at
Gravelines and then at Calais, when, after taking
an affectionate farewell of each other, they parted;
Charles and Margaret journeying by slow stages
towards Aix-la-Chapelle, which, by a decree of the
Golden Bull, had been chosen as the scene of the
emperor's coronation.</p>

<p>At Maestricht he reappointed Margaret as
regent, and gave her a Council presided over by
Philippe de Bourgogne, Bishop of Utrecht, and
Érard de la Marck, Bishop of Liége. The Council
of Malines, the Court of Holland, and the tribunals
of the other provinces were henceforth made subordinate
to the Council of the Regency established
by the emperor. This arrangement infringed the
privileges of these bodies, but Charles, deaf to their
protests, abolished all privileges which were contrary
to this new régime. In order to put an end to petty
squabbles and ensure an equal protection to all, he
gave, before starting for Germany, the command of
the army to Count Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> of Nassau. Accompanied
by Margaret he then left Maestricht and
passed a night at the castle of Wettheim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Charles's election had called forth much enthusiasm
in Germany. The towns he passed through gave
him a hearty welcome, for they looked to him to
restore order and redress their grievances.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of October he made his state entry
into Aix-la-Chapelle, where the electors of Mayence,
Cologne, and Trèves, and the ambassadors of the
Duke of Saxony and the Margrave of Brandenburg
had arrived the day before. Charles had been elected
emperor on June the 28th, 1519; but it was not
until October 23rd, 1520, that he was crowned at
Aix. There in the church of Notre-Dame, in
presence of a vast assembly, with every detail of
gorgeous ceremonial, the crown of Charlemagne was
placed upon his head; he swore to uphold the
Catholic faith, defend the Church, administer justice,
maintain the rights of the empire, recover its lost
possessions, and render due obedience to the Pope
and the Roman Church. The Archbishop of Cologne,
turning to the assembled crowd, asked the German
people if they would swear fealty to their prince and
uphold his government. A loud assent was given.
'Charles was then anointed on his head, breast, arms
and hands, clothed in the deacon's robe of Charlemagne,
and girt with the great emperor's sword,
crowned with his golden crown, and then with ring
on finger and ball and sceptre in hand, he was led to
the stone seat of empire.'<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The next day the Archbishop of Mayence proclaimed
that Charles had assumed the title of
Roman Emperor Elect. His coronation as Emperor
and King of Lombardy did not take place until
1530, when he was crowned at Bologna by Pope
Clement VII.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
On November 1st he summoned the States to
meet at Worms, and in January 1521 travelled
thither to be present at the Diet, where he and
Martin Luther met face to face for the first and
last time.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>REVOLT OF THE DUKE OF BOURBON</h3>

<p class="p2">Almost at the same time that Charles was
crowned at Aix, the most enterprising
and accomplished of the Turkish sultans,
Solyman the Magnificent, ascended the Ottoman
throne. The world has seldom seen such a brilliant
constellation of rulers as now filled the principal
thrones of Europe. Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span>, Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>, Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>,
Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, and Solyman the Magnificent each
possessed talents which would have made them conspicuous
in any age, but which together made the
history of Europe during the first half of the sixteenth
century peculiarly interesting.</p>

<p>After his coronation, Charles returned to Brussels
with Margaret. For some time past alarming news
had reached him from his regent in Spain, where
open rebellion had now broken out. Adrian of
Utrecht was quite unequal to the task of coping
with the insurgents, and first Medina del Campo,
then Valladolid, and lastly Tordesillas (where Queen
Joanna was confined) fell into the hands of the rebels.
The great seal and state papers were seized, Adrian
narrowly escaped being taken prisoner with his
Council, and only saved himself by flight.</p>

<p>When Joanna heard that the rebel leader Padilla
and his host had arrived before Tordesillas she ordered
the townspeople to welcome them, and ostensibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
made herself head of the revolution, authorising the
leaders to summon the Cortes to meet in her palace.
But although the members of the Junta declared her
sane, Joanna's refusal to sign any documents or come
to any decision hopelessly checkmated their efforts,
and early in December the Government troops were
able to take Tordesillas by assault after four hours'
desperate fighting.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile imploring letters reached Charles from
his Councillors begging him to return to Spain and
quell the rebellion; this he refused to do, until it
suited his convenience, but appointed two Spanish
nobles, the Constable and Admiral of Castile, to
assist Adrian in restoring order, with strict injunctions
to make no concessions. Before many months
were out peace was once more restored, and the
Communeros finally crushed in the following April
at the battle of Villalar.</p>

<p>In January 1521 Charles sailed up the Rhine to
attend the Diet which he had summoned to meet
at Worms. It opened on January the 28th, and
dragged on its wearisome deliberations for several
months. Of all the questions the emperor had to
solve, that of Luther was the hardest. The Pope
did his best to complicate matters by urging that
Luther should be condemned unheard; but the state
of public feeling was such that Charles deemed it
wiser to consult the Diet, who decided that the monk
should be heard. A herald was therefore despatched
to Wittemberg bearing a letter from the emperor
with a promise of safe conduct. Luther appeared at
Worms on April the 16th. Brought before Charles,
he admitted the authorship of his books, but refused
to withdraw any of his doctrines. He spoke boldly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
and impressively, but when he enlarged upon the
Pope's iniquities, the emperor reprimanded him, nor
would he listen to the monk's denial of the authority
of Councils. Charles was not impressed by Luther's
manner or bearing, and during the interview was
heard to remark, 'This man will never make me a
Lutheran.' This was their first and last encounter,
for the emperor and monk were destined never to
meet again.</p>

<p>The next day Charles handed his remarkable
declaration to the German princes in which he said:
'My predecessors ... left behind them the holy
Catholic rites that I should live and die therein, and
so until now with God's aid I have lived as becomes
a Christian emperor.... A single monk, led astray
by private judgment, has set himself against the
faith held by all Christians for a thousand years and
more, and impudently concludes that all Christians
up to now have erred. I have therefore resolved to
stake upon this cause all my dominions, my friends,
my body and my blood, my life and soul.... After
Luther's stiff-necked reply in my presence yesterday,
I now repent that I have so long delayed proceedings
against him and his false doctrines. I have now
resolved never again, under any circumstances, to
hear him. Under protection of his safe conduct he
shall be escorted home, but forbidden to preach and
seduce men with his evil doctrines and incite them
to rebellion....'</p>

<p>But Luther's brave bearing at Worms was his
most heroic moment, nor was his power in Germany
ever again so great as in 1521, nor was he ever again
so truly the voice of the people.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>On April the 25th Charles ordered him to leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Worms, and next day the monk departed, escorted by
twenty horsemen. A few days later an edict was
published in the emperor's name, and by authority
of the Diet, depriving him of all the privileges he
enjoyed as a subject of the empire, forbidding any
prince to harbour or protect him, and requiring all
to help in seizing his person as soon as the time
specified in the safe conduct had expired. In less
than a fortnight he had disappeared, rescued from
his adversaries by the Elector of Saxony, who kept
the place of his retreat carefully concealed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> had been actively engaged
in sending forces against the frontiers of Belgium
and Italy. Charles, through Margaret, made an
appeal to the States-General convoked at Mons on
February 9th, 1521. In a spirited speech she pointed
out the perfidious conduct of Francis, who she declared
was daily trying to induce the European powers to
make war against the emperor's dominions. Amongst
others she quoted his efforts to obtain support from
the Kings of Denmark and Scotland, the Dukes of
Savoy, Lorraine, and Ferrara, the republic, the
Swiss League, and Charles of Gueldres. She then
implored the assembly to grant help to protect the
empire from its enemies. The people were flattered
by this appeal to their patriotism, and hastened to
prove that their emperor had not appealed to them
in vain.</p>

<p>On the 5th of May 1521 the Archduke Ferdinand
concluded his marriage with Princess Anne of
Hungary, and Charles conferred the five duchies of
Austria, Carinthia, Carniola, Styria, and Tyrol upon
his brother, to which he added later the German
possessions inherited from Maximilian.</p>

<p>On May the 29th he confirmed a secret treaty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
with Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span> through Don John Manuel, his ambassador
in Rome, by which the Pope and emperor
agreed to join forces to expel the French out of the
Milanaise, to restore Parma and Piacenza to the
Church, the emperor helping the Pope to conquer
Ferrara, in return for the investiture of the kingdom
of Naples. This treaty was carefully concealed from
De Chièvres, whose aversion to a war with France
was well known. When at length he heard of it,
his grief was so great at this proof of his loss of
influence over his former pupil, that it is said to have
shortened his days. His death at this juncture
certainly hastened the war with France, though it
freed Charles from an irksome subjection and greatly
helped in the development of his character. From
henceforth the emperor was his own master, nor was
he ever again under another governor. Instead of
his boyish motto&mdash;'Nondum' (not yet), his device in
future was 'Plus ultra' (yet further).</p>

<p>The French were the first to cross the Pyrenees
and begin hostilities. When Charles, who was then
at Brussels, heard the news, he exclaimed: 'God be
praised that it is not I who begin the war: the King
of France wishes to make me greater than I am; for,
in a short time, either I shall be a very poor emperor,
or he will be a poor King of France.'<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>On the 17th of July Margaret again addressed the
assembled States at Ghent, for the exchequer was
very low, and men and money were needed for the
war. She implored them to use every effort to
protect their country, and restore peace by voting
the much-needed subsidies. She begged them to
avert the threatening storm, and with a voice moved
by emotion said: 'Because of the love and peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
affection his Majesty bears you, being a native of
these lands, born, brought up, and nourished amongst
you, he is anxious to protect you from danger, and
preserve you from all harm and oppression, by driving
war from out of his dominions, keeping you in peace.
Which things his Majesty has willingly put before
you as his good and loyal subjects, because of the
entire confidence he has in you, so that you may
know all his affairs and understand the danger you
are in, for on this depends either your safety or ruin.'
She then promised 'a perpetual safety and abundance
of all good things' after peace was restored, and
freedom from subjection to France. She praised the
fine example of Spain and Austria, who, although
they hardly knew his Majesty, had nevertheless of
their own accord raised superb armaments; 'and you
who have his person with you ready to use his life,
his goods, and all that God has given him to preserve,
help, and defend you, ought not to be less generous
or less courageous than others, seeing that the case
touches you so closely, and with the noise of war so
near, knowing the harm which may come upon you
if war breaks out, and seeing that the quarrel is just,
which is as true as God is, and that He will help his
Majesty. And on this account you ought to take
courage and show yourselves bold and fearless, and
be more willing and anxious than any others, as his
Majesty does not doubt you will be, and without
waiting to be asked, offer liberally your persons,
goods, and chattels (as you have always done in
times past) to help his Majesty in this same enterprise,
which is for your own and the public good.'<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Margaret had not miscalculated the effect of this
speech on her audience. Enthusiasm and loyalty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
towards the emperor and herself passed all bounds
and spread like wildfire throughout the Netherlands.
An army of 22,000 men was quickly raised, and
assembled in the outskirts of Malines. Part of
these troops the emperor despatched under the
Count of Nassau to subdue the inroads of Robert
de la Marck, lord of Bouillon, known as the wild
Boar of the Ardennes, who had been giving considerable
trouble. The emperor having offended him, he
left Charles's service and threw himself upon France
for protection. In the heat of his resentment he had
the audacity to send a herald to Worms to declare
war against the emperor before the assembled Diet.
To punish this insolent vassal the Count of Nassau
was sent at the head of 20,000 men to invade his
territories, and in a few days took every place but
Sedan, and reduced De la Marck to beg for clemency.
Nassau then advanced towards the borders of France,
where Charles of Gueldres was ravaging the Northern
provinces, and Henry d'Albret had crossed the
Pyrenees and occupied Navarre.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a congress had been held at Calais,
under Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>'s mediation, with a view to settling
all differences and establishing peace. Henry gave
Wolsey full powers to arrange the negotiations, but
the Cardinal, anxious to please both Francis and
Charles, ended by satisfying neither, and the congress
broke up without any definite result. During its
progress Wolsey journeyed to Bruges and had a
meeting there with Charles and Margaret, the latter
having come in hot haste to visit her nephew,
anxious to use her influence to procure an armistice.
The Cardinal was received by the emperor and his aunt
with as much respect and magnificence as though he
had been King of England, but instead of furthering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
the treaty of peace, Wolsey, in his master's name,
concluded a secret alliance with the emperor against
France. This treaty, which was drawn up at Bruges
on August 25th, 1521, and signed by Margaret and
Jean de Berghes for the emperor, and by Wolsey for
the King of England, arranged a marriage between
Charles and his cousin Mary Tudor (King Henry's
only child and apparent heir) as soon as the princess
should have completed her twelfth year; both Charles
and Henry agreeing to invade France in the spring
of 1523 from opposite sides, each with an army of
40,000 men&mdash;the emperor promising to visit England
on his way to Spain early in the following year. It
was especially stipulated that 'one month before
Charles undertook the voyage he would notify the
time of it to the King of England, who would then
send his fleet to sea, with about 3000 armed men
on board, to drive away all enemies and pirates from
the Channel and English seas, so that the emperor
might safely come over to Dover or Sandwich. The
King of England would receive the emperor with the
greatest honour and accompany him to Falmouth,
whilst the English navy would escort the emperor's
fleet from Zealand to Falmouth, and together remain
in that port until he embarked and then accompany
him to Spain.'<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>During the years that had passed since Margaret
left Savoy she never lost interest in the memorial
church she was building at Brou. In September
1521 she sent her treasurer Marnix and some
members of her Council to report on the progress
of the work. The church was rapidly gaining shape,
and the outer walls were nearing completion under
the skilful direction of Louis Van Boghen. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
following letter from Loys de Gleyrens, prior of the
monastery of Brou (written to Margaret on the 2nd
of September 1521), gives a detailed account of de
Marnix's visit:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">'To our much-honoured Lady and very gracious
Mother,&mdash;God grant you a good and long life. You
will be pleased to know that the day of the feast of
Saint Augustine Monseigneur Marnix came to visit
your church of Brou, with the gentlemen of your
Council of Bourg, and saw the progress of the same,
and found that your two chapels in the aisle of the
choir are roofed over, as well as the higher and lower
aisles and oratories above and below, on the side of
the belfry, and that the pipes and gurgoyles for
carrying off water falling from the roofs are fixed on
the said aisles. And the belfry has grown this year
to the height of twenty-three to twenty-five feet....'
He goes on to say that the workmen have plenty
of materials, wood, etc., to finish the work&mdash;but that
money is running short, and that only about fifteen
or sixteen florins are left, which will hardly last till
All Saints Day, and unless more is supplied, the work
must be interrupted ... 'but at present it is in the
best state and appearance possible, and ought shortly
to be finished, as those will tell you who have seen
it....'<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Meanwhile the league between Charles and the
Pope had produced great results in Italy; Lombardy
being the chief centre of war. On November the
19th the Papal-Imperialist army entered Milan, and
within a fortnight the French held only the town of
Cremona, the fortress of Milan, and a few scattered
strongholds. Parma and Piacenza surrendered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span>, but amidst the rejoicings which followed this
brilliant victory and the fulfilment of his dearest
wishes, the Pope was suddenly struck down with
malaria at Magliana, and died after a few days' illness
on the 1st of December 1521, in the forty-sixth year
of his age.</p>

<p>This wholly unexpected event caused a cessation of
hostilities for a while&mdash;both monarchs turning their
attention to the proceedings of the Conclave. News
of the Pope's death was brought to Charles on the
12th of December, and he hastened to write a diplomatic
letter to his uncle, King Henry, and fully
explained his intentions to the Bishop of Badajoz,
his ambassador in England, promising to do his
utmost to secure Wolsey's election to the Papacy.
But after the Conclave had sat for fourteen days, it
was announced on the 9th of January 1522 that not
Wolsey, but Adrian of Utrecht had been elected
Pope. The election of the emperor's old tutor came
as a surprise to Europe. Charles received the news
at Brussels, and on January the 21st wrote to Mezza,
his ambassador in London: 'However anxious was our
wish that Pace (Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>'s secretary) should have
arrived in Rome at the right time, and that the
letters we had written in favour of the Sieur Legate
(Wolsey) had been conducive to the fulfilment of his
wishes, and those of our uncle the king; yet must we
be thankful, the object we had at heart having thus
failed, that the choice fell upon Cardinal Tortosa,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
whose elevation, next after the Cardinal of York,
will certainly be most for the good, not of ourselves
only, but of the whole of Christendom. I hope to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
have the greater interest with him, who under
my own roof was my instructor in morals and
literature.'<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The new Pope was in Spain when the unexpected
news of his election was brought to him. Adrian
<span class="smcap">VI.</span>'s letter to his former pupil, dated Saragossa,
May 3rd, 1522, is interesting as confirming the
emperor's statement that he did not interfere in
favour of his election, but honestly did his best
for Wolsey, to whom he had promised his influence
with the Conclave.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'Very dear and much-beloved Son!&mdash;Health and
apostolical benediction. I have been rejoiced on
receiving the letter which your Majesty has
written to me with your own hand.... I am fully
convinced of the satisfaction which you will derive
from my election to the Popedom; and I never
entertained a doubt that had it depended alone on
your goodwill and affection towards me, your
suffrage would have been in my favour; but I was
equally aware that it was neither suitable to your
own interests nor to the good of the Christian
commonwealth, that you should have used any
solicitation in my behalf, knowing that such interference
would have been fatal to your good understanding
with one (Wolsey) who at this moment is of all
others most necessary to your welfare in Italy....
Although my election may in one respect be attended
with inconvenience, in taking me away from the
management of your affairs in Spain, yet this will be
so much overbalanced by other considerations, as
nowise to diminish the joy which it will occasion
you. And in this my election, the feeling which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
influenced the sacred College of Cardinals, as you
will readily believe, and as has been intimated by
them to Don John Manuel, was, that it would be a
choice agreeable to your Majesty: for no one, it
appeared, would have obtained their votes who could
be considered objectionable either to you, or to the
King of France.</p>

<p>'I cannot, therefore, express my satisfaction in
having attained to this elevation without the exercise
of your influence, inconsistent as that would
have been with the purity and sincerity which divine
and human rights require in such proceedings; and
in saying this, you will be assured that I feel as much,
if not more truly devoted to your Majesty, than if I
had owed to your means and prayers my present
advancement....</p>

<p>'Sire, I pray God to grant you a happy and long
life. Written at Saragossa the 3rd of May, <i>ad
tempus sacræ Romanæ ecclesiæ</i>. Entirely yours.'<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Adrian <span class="smcap">VI.</span> was an upright, conscientious, and
honest man, but quite unfitted for the high position
he was called upon to fill, and his reign of ten
months was unsuccessful and unhappy. As he
himself once exclaimed, 'Let a man be never so
good, how much depends upon the times in which
he is born.' A learned scholar and rigid disciplinarian,
he regarded the conduct of the reformers with
horror; but at the same time candidly acknowledged
the abuses and corruptions that disgraced both the
Court and Church of Rome. This moderation,
whilst it disgusted the great ecclesiastics in Italy,
tended to encourage the reformation in Germany.
A host of pamphlets and caricatures were circulated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
and helped to popularise the new ideas and spread
the reformed religion far and wide. Charles hastened
to forbid under pain of death the printing of literature
directed against the Pope or the Church of
Rome, and ordered Francis Van der Hulst to hunt
all Lutherans out of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>On the 15th of March 1522 Margaret convoked
the States-General at Brussels. The emperor,
through his Chancellor, complimented the citizens
on their loyal conduct and bravery at the recent
siege of Tournay, which had greatly helped towards
its reduction. 'The French,' he said, 'have sustained
a great loss in losing Milan and Tournay,
which are of such importance, as every one knows.'
His approaching journey to Spain was then
announced, and he informed them of the treaties
he had made, and the precautions taken for the
defence of the country, thanking his brave subjects
for the zeal they had shown in his service. He
informed them that during his absence the government
would be confided to Margaret, 'who for so
long has shown by her praiseworthy, memorable
services and great experience, that she well knows
how to honourably acquit herself of the said government
and administration. For which good rule and
conduct his Majesty and you are beholden to her
through the fervent zeal and natural love she bears
you.' The Chancellor ended his long speech by
saying that the emperor hoped they would live
peaceably with each other during his absence&mdash;'for
their strength lay in unity....'<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Charles, who was now preparing to visit England
on his way to Spain, was sadly in want of money.
Margaret did her best to help him, and in order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
raise funds pawned her jewels to the Count of Hochstrate.
'My said Lady, obeying the order of his
Majesty, has offered to leave her rings with the said
Hochstrate, until he has been acquitted and discharged
of the last sums he furnished ... at the
very pressing request and insistence of my said
Lady, knowing that in this lies his Majesty's honour,
but he has behaved so well that he will not keep
them.'<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Before leaving Bruges the emperor made his will
on the 22nd of May 1522, arranging that if he died
in Flanders his body was to be buried at Bruges,
near his grandmother Mary of Burgundy. He then
bade farewell to Margaret and set out for England,
sailing from Calais, with a gorgeous retinue of a
thousand horse and two thousand courtiers, and landing
at Dover towards the end of May, was welcomed
by Wolsey in his master's name. It had been
arranged that King Henry should meet the emperor
on the downs between Dover and Canterbury; but
to show him greater honour the king rode into
Dover, and after together inspecting the English
fleet, which was duly admired by the emperor and
his train, the two monarchs made a triumphal progress
through Canterbury, Sittingbourne, and
Rochester to Gravesend. From Gravesend the
splendid processions rowed in royal barges to
Greenwich. At the entrance door of the palace
Queen Katharine stood awaiting her nephew, surrounded
by her ladies, and holding little Princess
Mary by the hand. The emperor, kneeling on one
knee, then asked for his aunt's blessing, which was
readily granted, and from henceforward for six
weeks his visit to England was a continual round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
of feasting, dancing, hunting, masquerading, and
splendid entertainments.</p>

<p>But amidst all this hospitality his thoughts were
mainly fixed on Spain, and as he wrote to Margaret,
'the six weeks seemed a thousand years.'</p>

<p>Whilst Charles was at Greenwich a messenger
arrived from France bearing a letter to King Henry,
in which Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> bade defiance to the King of
England. The letter was handed to the emperor for
his perusal, who must have rejoiced at its contents,
for now he and his uncle could join forces against
their common enemy France; and soon after an
eternal friendship was solemnly sworn between them
upon the Sacrament in Saint George's Chapel,
Windsor, and an abiding alliance in peace and war
cemented by Charles's betrothal to his cousin Mary
Tudor. Glittering pageants in London and Windsor,
where Charles was made a Knight of the Garter
under his uncle's presidency, brought his visit to a
close, and on July the 6th the emperor set sail once
more for the port of Santander.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>A few weeks later an Anglo-Belgian army, under
Florent d'Ysselstein, Count of Buren, invaded
Picardy, whilst the Earl of Surrey's fleet hovered
off the Norman coast, and threatened all French
shipping in the Channel.</p>

<p>Margaret meanwhile was busily employed in
harrowing the Duke of Gueldres, whose troops
appeared before Leyden, and pillaged the village of
La Haye. The States of Friesland upheld the
regent in her endeavours, but it was not until June
the 4th, 1524, that a truce was concluded with
Gueldres, and peace restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Whilst Charles, Henry, and Francis were thus
employed wasting each other's strength, the Turkish
sultan, Solyman the Magnificent, invaded Hungary
with a large army, and took Belgrade. Encouraged
by this success, he besieged the Island of Rhodes,
then the seat of the Knights of Saint John of
Jerusalem. The Grand Master of Villers de L'Isle
Adam sent imploring messages to the powers of
Europe begging for assistance. Adrian <span class="smcap">VI.</span> did his
utmost to persuade Charles and Francis to forget
their quarrels and join forces in saving Rhodes, then
the chief bulwark of Christianity in the East. On
March the 3rd, 1523, he wrote to Charles exhorting
him and all Christian princes to make peace with one
another, and wage a common war against the Turks.
He complains that 'so far all his exhortations have
been fruitless, and the Turks have conquered Belgrade
on one side, and it is said they have taken
Rhodes on the other. There is no doubt that the
Turks will continue their conquests in Hungary
(where the emperor's sister Mary is queen), as well
as in the Mediterranean, till they have rendered
themselves masters of the whole of Europe. This
danger can only be averted by a reconciliation of all
Christian princes....' The Pope ends by saying
that he has written in the same sense to the Kings
of France and England.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>But the rival princes turned a deaf ear to all these
entreaties, and after six months of incredible courage,
patience, and bravery on the part of the garrison,
the gallant little band of knights were forced to
capitulate, and the town was razed to the ground.
When too late, Charles, Henry, and Francis, ashamed
of their conduct, tried to lay the blame of this misfortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
on each other, and Charles, by way of
reparation, gave the Knights of Saint John the
Island of Malta, which from henceforth became the
chief home of their order.</p>

<p>The year 1523 was marked by the revolt and
conspiracy of the Constable of Bourbon, a powerful
and accomplished French nobleman descended from
the Montpensier branch of the Bourbon family, who
through his marriage with Suzanne, daughter and
heiress of the Duke of Bourbon, had acquired the
wealth and honours of that powerful house.
Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> on his accession had made him Constable
of France, and treated him with every
mark of favour.</p>

<p>When the king left Italy in 1516, Bourbon remained
behind as lieutenant-general of the French
forces, and greatly distinguished himself by his
military talents and valour; but soon after his return
to France he fell into disfavour, and from henceforth
became the victim of a vindictive persecution. The
cause of this sudden change is generally attributed
to a passionate attachment on the part of Louise of
Savoy, the king's mother, who, on his wife Suzanne's
death in 1521, offered her hand to Bourbon; but the
Constable declining the honour, the humiliated queen,
in revenge, disputed Suzanne's will, herself claiming
the succession to the Bourbon estates as next of
kin. In this she was aided and abetted by the
Chancellor Du Prat, and soon persuaded the king to
withhold Bourbon's appointments, and disallow his
just claims for money he had furnished during the
war in Italy. The Constable at first bore these
indignities with great moderation, but when in
presence of the whole army the king passed him
over, and gave the command of the van to the Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of Alençon, the injured Constable retired from the
Court, and began a secret correspondence with
Charles's Ministers, offering his services to the
emperor.</p>

<p>The campaign arranged between Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and
his nephew for the simultaneous invasion of France
had not proved successful, but led to a more formidable
attempt in the following year. Charles therefore
welcomed the proposed advent of so powerful a
partisan as Bourbon, from whose revolt he expected
great advantages, and warmly received his secret
overtures. It was proposed that the emperor should
enter France by the Pyrenees, whilst Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, in
co-operation with Margaret, should invade Picardy,
and Bourbon with twelve hundred Germans penetrate
into Germany. A lengthy despatch sent to
Charles from London, on June the 1st, 1523, by De
Praet, his ambassador, and Marnix, Margaret's
treasurer (both accredited at the English Court),
gives a full account of a negotiation with Wolsey on
the conditions of the above confederacy, and shows
what a large part Margaret played in the arrangements.
In the latter part of the despatch mention is
made of the King and Queen of Denmark's visit to
the Netherlands, where they fled to take refuge from
the troubles which threatened them in Denmark.</p>

<p>' ... Sire! By our last letters your Majesty has
been able to see and understand the offers we have
made to the King of England and the Sieur Legate
(Wolsey) through the intervention of madame, your
Majesty's aunt, in reference to the co-operation and
assistance of the army which the said king would
send across the sea against the common enemy of
your Majesty and himself.</p>

<p>'... Sire! They could nowise be satisfied with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
the number we have to offer for the said co-operation,
but persisted in pressing for three thousand
horse and five thousand foot with the half of the
artillery munition and equipage, requiring us to
write immediately to the said lady, which we have
done, and have, moreover, received her answer. She,
having communicated with M. de Beuren, your
Majesty's captain-general, and acting on his advice,
declares that it is quite impossible to augment the
number she had already offered, to wit, two thousand
good horse, and four thousand foot, with twelve
pieces of field-artillery; but if they would pass the
sea, we should be ready to give all the assistance in
our power; and were the enemy to offer battle or
commence a siege, there would be a force always
ready of ten or twelve thousand Flemish foot to
come to their assistance....' The despatch goes
on to say that after several days spent in discussions,
during which time Wolsey pressed for more troops
from the Netherlands, and lost his temper, nothing
definite was settled. 'Although I, Marnix, have ...
pressed for permission to return, the Sieur Legate
has nevertheless wished and requested that I should
be present and concerned in these proceedings, with
me De Praet, in order to make a report of them to
madame.</p>

<p>'Sire! The said madame (Margaret) has written to
inform us how the King of Denmark,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> who, with the
queen and his children, is, as we have already made
known to your Majesty, in your Low Countries, has
demanded of her three things. One that she should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
be willing to render sufficient aid and assistance to
enable him to reconquer his kingdom; a second, that
she should grant a passport to one of his people
whom he intends to despatch to your Majesty, and by
him should write to you in his favour; the third,
that you should write to monseigneur, your Majesty's
brother, and the electoral princes, that right and
justice may be rendered to him in his quarrels and
contentions against his uncle the Duke of Holstein,
who, with the aid of the city of Lubeck, has occasioned
his expulsion. To these demands, in as much
as regards the two latter, madame has signified her
willing acquiescence; but, in respect to the first, she
begs to be excused, on account of the impossibility of
acceding to it; and refers all to the good pleasure of
your Majesty....'<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>In a postscript of the same despatch De Praet says,
referring to Bourbon's intended revolt: 'In truth,
Sire, this affair, I know not why, has not long remained
a secret, and in a short time cannot fail to be
publicly known. Even at this Court there are to my
knowledge more than ten people now acquainted
with it. The day before yesterday, when the cardinal
and I met concerning the present war, he immediately
began to talk of the coming over of Bourbon,
and related the whole transaction from beginning to
end, and this in the presence of the Duke of Suffolk,
Messieurs Talbot and Wingfield, three bishops,
and the treasurer Marnix. M. de Badajoz and I
knew it ever since the past month of January, but
we obstinately denied it before the King of England
and the cardinal, until your Majesty orders us to be
candid on the subject.'<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The emperor sent Adrian de Croy, Lord of Beaurain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
to treat secretly with the Duke of Bourbon,
and on the 22nd of July he writes: 'Sire! I came
into communication with M. de Bourbon the 3rd day
of July at Monbrison, which is three days' journey
within the French territory, and there treated with
him.</p>

<p>'Monsieur de Bourbon is ready to declare himself
the enemy of France.... I have despatched ...
my secretary to the King of England to apprise him
of all I have thought necessary, urging him to hasten
his army according to the advice of M. de Bourbon;
and I have advertised madame (Margaret) that if
she should hear of what has passed, respecting the
said duke from any other quarter, to be cautious, lest
any difficulty should be thrown in the way.</p>

<p>'M. de Bourbon has made friends with many rich
people who are ready to come forward with several
thousand crowns for the payment of his debts, at
which I rejoice, for he is a fine fellow....</p>

<p>'I have treated with him according to the secret
articles with which you were pleased to charge me.
He will take in marriage either Madame Eleanor or
Madame Katharine,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> but would greatly prefer the
former.</p>

<p>'M. de Bourbon will stir up a fine commotion in France.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Adrian de Croy</span>'</p>

<p class="p2">On the 9th of August 1523 Louis de Praet also
wrote to Charles that 'the Duke of Bourbon declares
himself ready to serve him (the emperor) against all
and every person, whoever he may be, and to enter
into his offensive and defensive league ...' but in
return 'the duke expects that he (the emperor) will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
give him his sister (Eleanor, Queen of Portugal) in
marriage, or if the queen refuses to be his wife,
Madame Katharine. The dower of Madame Eleanor
or Madame Katharine to consist of 200,000 écus,
while the duke promises to give his future wife a
jointure of 15,000 écus a year....'</p>

<p>'The Duke of Bourbon also expects that the
emperor will give him the command of ten thousand
German troops, and 100,000 écus wherewith to pay
the German as well as the other troops ... and
that the King of England will contribute 100,000
écus for the maintenance of the German and other
troops of the duke....'<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Soon after Bourbon made good his escape and
reached Italy in safety, although Francis, whose
suspicions were aroused too late, tried to arrest him.</p>

<p>On hearing of his safe arrival the emperor, writing
from Logrono, hastened to send him a warm welcome.
'My brother, on the 16th of September Gracian
arrived and gave me news of you, which afforded me
the greatest satisfaction.... Anxious as I am for
your safety, you may rest assured there is nothing
which the King of England, my good father, and I,
as well as all our friends and allies, will not be ready
to do for your succour and assistance; and that,
faithful to my promise, you will ever find me a true
prince, your good brother, cousin, and friend, who,
come what may of good or evil fortune, will never
abandon your interest, as I am sure you will never
cease to feel and do the like for me....</p>

<p>'I pray you, my brother, if it be possible, that you
will speedily unite yourself and yours with my army,
at least with that part of it which is in Italy, as I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
communicated my desire to them that this junction
be accomplished, when and where the occasion may
offer....'</p>

<p>At the same time the emperor wrote to Margaret,
and, after referring to the difficulties of communication
with Bourbon, and lamenting that Francis had
seized several of the duke's friends and adherents, he
asks her to write to Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and request him to
order the Duke of Suffolk (then commanding the
English troops in Picardy) to detain every prisoner
of rank and not allow them to be ransomed. This
was no doubt by way of reprisals, but when the English
army under Suffolk was within eleven leagues of
Paris, it was driven back by Vendome and his troops,
and a severe sickness breaking out amongst the
soldiers, this unsuccessful campaign was brought to
a close. Thus the intended great invasion of France
by the allies dwindled from various causes into three
separate and unavailing attacks from Spain, Germany,
and England.</p>

<p>On the 14th of September 1523 Adrian <span class="smcap">VI.</span> died in
Rome after a short illness, and was buried in the
church of Santa Maria dell'Anima. His death again
raised Wolsey's hopes of the Papacy. Although
Margaret sincerely mourned the loss of her old
friend, still she lost no time in doing her utmost to
procure the English cardinal's election. De Praet,
writing from London to the emperor on the 6th of
October, says: 'Moreover, Sire, I have to inform
your Majesty that I have received letters from
madame (Margaret), dated the 25th of last month,
containing the afflicting news of the decease of the
Holy Father, which took place on the 14th of the
said month, commanding me on this account to repair
without delay to the said cardinal (Wolsey) to give
him as it may so happen the first intelligence of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
event, and to offer him on her part all the favour and
assistance in her power towards his promotion to this
dignity. This I lost no time in doing according to
her order, as well on the part of your Majesty as on
hers; to which he made the most grateful and suitable
reply, expressing his profound thanks to madame
for such demonstrations of her goodwill in offering
her services for his advancement to a dignity of which
he felt himself utterly unworthy.</p>

<p>'Nevertheless, in acknowledging her gracious intentions,
he could not but bear in mind in what
manner your Majesty, when with the king at Windsor,
had touched upon this subject, exhorting him to
think of it, and promising every possible aid on your
part in bringing about its accomplishment.</p>

<p>'He expressed the willingness of one who was
always ready to conform with the wishes and advice
of both your Majesties, begging that madame, in case
such a promotion and election should appear to her
as tending to the benefit of Christendom, and to the
common interests of your Majesties, would write
without a moment's delay to your ambassador in
Rome, and to other of your good friends there....'<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The emperor replied from Pampeluna on November
27th: 'The principal point is the advancement
of the cardinal (Wolsey) to the papal dignity. We
have always desired, and with most sincere good
feeling and intention have wished to promote this to
the utmost of our power, having full recollection how
we and the king, our good father and brother, being
at Windsor, opened to him our minds on this subject,
exhorting him to think of it, and promising our
best services in his assistance, because it appeared to
us that his promotion and election would be attended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
with great good to Christendom, and advantage to
our common interest.... We firmly believe that
the Cardinal de Medicis will give his assistance to
the Sieur Legate, from the little chance, we are informed,
of his own success; and we well know and
acknowledge how cordially and sincerely madame, our
good aunt, is occupied in this affair, not only in her
own name, but in ours. We entertain a good hope,
therefore, that all these efforts will prosper, and are
anxiously expecting favourable news which has been
hitherto retarded on account of the tempestuous
weather at sea.'</p>

<p>On the 15th of December the emperor writes to
De Praet: 'We have here received the news by a
letter from the Marquis de Finale that, on the 19th
of November, Cardinal de Medicis was elected Pope.
... You will do well to communicate the above to
the seigneurs, the king, and the cardinal, advertising
them that our ambassador, the Duke of Sessa, had
written to inform us that he was doing everything in
his power, and with the utmost diligence, to influence
the votes of the Conclave in favour of the Sieur
Legate.'<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>It certainly appears from the above correspondence
that Charles used all his influence in Wolsey's favour
in both this and the former election, but the cardinal
himself chose to consider otherwise, and from this
date he visibly cooled in his friendship, and though
outwardly affecting to rejoice in the Cardinal de
Medicis' elevation, he never forgave the emperor his
supposed duplicity.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>CAPTURE OF FRANCIS I.</h3>

<p class="p2">On September the 24th, 1524, Margaret's
youngest niece, Katharine, who had lived
most of her life shut up with her mad
mother in the gloomy palace of Tordesillas, was
married to John <span class="smcap">III.</span>, King of Portugal. The marriage
took place at Anyaguia, in the presence of
Charles, who had but lately recovered from a bad
attack of fever. In a letter to the Duke of Bourbon
on September 5th, he says: 'Regarding my own
person, I would most willingly have gone to Barcelona
according to your wish, if my affairs had permitted
me to do so. But I must first conclude the marriage
of my sister, Madame Katharine, and despatch some
affairs of this kingdom. Besides, I have for several
days been suffering from an intermittent fever, which
has hindered me from attending much to business.
The said fever is, however, much diminished, and I
hope, with God's help, to be soon restored to
health!...'<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>During the spring of the same year Bourbon (who
together with Lannoy, Viceroy of Naples, and the
Marquis of Pescara was in command of the imperialist
army) had gained his first success over the French,
and driven them out of the Milanese with the loss of
the Chevalier Bayard (April 30th); but during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
following summer the rebel duke found great difficulties
to encounter. He had marched on Marseilles,
hoping to reduce that town, but lack of means and
provisions obliged him to retrace his steps to Italy,
where he was met by a powerful army under Bonnivet.
The French general soon retook Milan, and then
laid siege to Pavia, held for the emperor by Antonio
de Leyva. Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>, disregarding all advice,
hastened to join his army in Italy determined, as
he said, to take Pavia or fall in the attempt. For
four weary months the siege dragged on, and then
came the news which startled all Europe. On
February the 24th (the emperor's birthday), 1525, was
fought the battle of Pavia, and before night fell the
French army was utterly defeated, the king a
prisoner, and the flower of the chivalry of France
either dead or taken captive.</p>

<p>Whilst the battle was still raging the Abbot of
Najera sent the following despatch to the emperor:&mdash;'At
midnight the army began to move. The soldiers
penetrated into the enclosure by three openings
they had made in the wall. At daybreak the enemy
attacked the rearguard, and the Imperial German
and Spanish troops engaged the Swiss, German, and
Italian troops of the King of France, who soon fled
as they heard the "good" Antonio de Leyva was in
their rear.</p>

<p>'The victory is complete. The King of France is
made prisoner. He has two very slight wounds in
the face. His horse has been killed. When he fell to
the ground the viceroy placed himself immediately
over him. The king has also an insignificant wound
in one of his legs. The whole of the French army
is annihilated.</p>

<p>'The Admiral of France died in my arms, not fifty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
yards from the place where the king had fallen. La
Pallice is dead. The King of Navarre, Lescun,
Montmorency, and other captains are prisoners.</p>

<p>'A great number of French infantry have been
drowned in the Ticino. The imperial army is still
pursuing the enemy. It is expected that at the end
of the day 10,000 of the enemy will have been killed.</p>

<p>'The Marquis of Pescara has done wonders. He
has three wounds. The imperialists had sixteen
pieces of artillery, but not a single shot has been
fired.... (From the palace of Pavia, the 24th day
of February 1525.)</p>

<p>'<i>Postscriptum.</i>&mdash;To-day is the feast of the Apostle
Saint Matthew, on which, five-and-twenty years ago,
your Majesty is said to have been born. Five-and-twenty
thousand times thanks and praise to God for
his mercy! Your Majesty is from this day in a
position to prescribe laws to Christians and Turks
according to your pleasure.'<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Charles de Lannoy, Viceroy of Naples, wrote the
same day announcing the victory to the emperor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'Sire,&mdash;We gave battle yesterday, and it pleased
God to give you victory, which was so well followed
up that you hold the King of France a prisoner in
my hands. I beseech you, earnestly as it is possible
to do, to think of your affairs, and to make prompt
execution now that God has sent you such a favourable
opportunity; for you will never have a more
propitious time than the present to demand restitution
of the crowns justly appertaining to you, for
you owe no obligation to any prince in Italy; nor
can they longer hope for protection from the King of
France, as you hold him captive. Sire, I think you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
remember the saying of M. de Bersale, "that God
sends to men once in their lives a fruitful August,
but if they allow it to pass without gathering a
harvest, it is a chance whether the opportunity is
given them again." I say not this believing that
your Majesty is disposed to neglect your advantages,
but only because I feel it a duty so to speak. Sire,
M. de Bourbon acquitted himself well, and performed
good service. Sire, the victory which God has given
you happened on St. Matthew's Day, which is the
day of your Majesty's birth.</p>

<p>'From the camp where the King of France was
lodged, before Pavia, the 25th day of February 1525.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Charles de Lannoy</span>'<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<a href="images/illus268_b.jpg">View larger image</a></p>

<p>Francis showed extraordinary courage throughout
the battle. When surrounded, unhorsed, and wounded
he refused to yield to Bourbon, exclaiming: 'I know
no Duke of Bourbon but myself!' but handed his
sword to Lannoy, who received it on his knees, and
immediately offered the captive king his own, saying,
'It did not become so great a monarch to remain
disarmed in the presence of one of the emperor's
subjects.' Francis was immediately taken to the
imperial camp, and de Lannoy despatched Commander
Peñalosa to the emperor announcing the
great victory. Francis gave the envoy a passport
through France, and the following letter to his
mother, Louise of Savoy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'Madame,&mdash;To let you know the extent of my
misfortune&mdash;of all things nothing remains to me but
honour, and life which is safe. Knowing that in
your adversity and sorrow this news would give you
comfort, I requested permission to send you this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
letter, which was readily granted. I beg you not
to yield to the extremity of grief, but to direct all
things with your accustomed prudence; for I have
firm hope that at last God will not abandon me.
I commend to your care my children and your own.
I beseech you, moreover, to grant free passage to the
messenger who brings you this letter, as he is bound
for Spain, on a mission to the emperor, to learn what
kind of treatment I am to receive. Commending
myself to your favour and affection, I remain, your
very humble and obedient son,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Francoys</span>'</p>
</div>

<p>With Francis were also captured Henry, King of
Navarre, the Marshal de Montmorency, the Duke
de Nevers, the high treasurer Babou de la Bourdaizière,
the Count of Saint Paul, the Marshal of
Fleuranges, Du Bellay, and many others. Meanwhile
Margaret had been kept well informed of the progress
of affairs in Italy, and on the 6th of March
wrote to the Count of Gavre, Governor-General of
Flanders: 'I have had certain news to-day that on
the 24th of February the emperor's army attacked
the King of France in the camp of Forte; that,
although it was well fortified, the king was made a
prisoner, fourteen hundred men of war killed in the
camp, and that the rest who took flight were all
taken and killed, and it is not known if any escaped.
I require you, because of the consolation this news will
be to the vassals and subjects of your government,
to inform them of it, and exhort and command them
to give thanks to God for the victory he has sent us,
by fireworks, processions, prayers, and other devout
works, and above all to pray for the souls of those
who have died.'<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
On the 13th of this same month she confirmed this
joyful news in a letter sent from Malines to the
Council of Flanders announcing the arrival of Grapain
'with letters in which he certifies that he was
present at the said battle, and the capture of the
King of France by the hand of the viceroy, he himself
helping to disarm the king, and confirms the capture
and death of the principal personages in the kingdom ... and
in the said battle only a hundred and
fifty of our men were killed ... and that the said
king has sent to release the Prince of Orange and
the Lord of Bossu and others of our side who were
prisoners.'<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>This great victory was of the utmost importance
to the Netherlands, and Margaret hoped that it
would lead to the recovery of the duchy of Burgundy
and the county of Charolais and their dependencies.</p>

<p>Three days after the battle Francis received a
visit from the chiefs of the victorious army, who
offered him their sympathy, the Marquis of Pescara
even appearing in mourning. During the interview
the king showed great fortitude, and with a show of
cheerfulness discussed various points of the battle
with his capturers. The castle of Pizzighitone was
chosen for his temporary prison until instructions
were received from Spain.</p>

<p>The emperor was at Madrid when the messenger
arrived with the news of the victory. Charles showed
extraordinary self-control, and neither by voice nor
manner gave any outward sign of exultation. As if
dazed, he repeated the words of the messenger: 'The
battle is fought and the king is your prisoner!'<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> And
then, hardly permitting the congratulations of the surrounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
courtiers, he retired to his oratory, where,
falling on his knees, he spent a long interval in
prayer, after which he asked for details of his victory.
Bonfires and illuminations and all public rejoicings
were strictly forbidden as being unsuitable 'when a
Christian king had fallen into such great misfortune.'
This moderation and humility called forth the admiration
of all who witnessed it. Dr. Sampson,
King Henry's ambassador at the Court of Madrid,
wrote to Wolsey: ' ... The emperor hath used
such demeanour in all things, both by word, deed,
and countenance, and toward all manner of persons,
that every wise man hath been most joyful to
see it....'<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>On the following day Charles went in procession
to the church of Our Lady of Atocha to give thanks
for the victory, the preacher, however, being forbidden
to enlarge on the triumph. But this extremely
humble attitude did not prevent Charles from making
the most of his success. On the 14th of March he
sent the following letter to his brother-in-law, the
King of Portugal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'It is known to you how the King of France, at
the head of a powerful army, made a descent upon
Italy, to seize and usurp territories appertaining to
our empire, and also our kingdom of Naples, which
he had sent the Duke of Albany to invade, and how
he had besieged the city of Pavia, and the progress
he had made, all which he wrote to you by Luis
Alvarez de Tavora, a noble hidalgo of your own
lineage. By a courier who came to us from thence
(Pavia), we learned the news of the victory which
God has given to our army against the said King of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
France, whom we hold prisoner, all which we did
not then make known to you, because we were expecting
the arrival of a cavalier who was present at
the battle, bringing letters from the captains-general
of our said army. This said cavalier has since
arrived, from whom we have minutely heard all that
occurred, which is as follows: On St. Matthew's Day,
the day of our birth, which is the 24th of February,
although the said King of France was entrenched
very strongly, and tried by every possible means to
avoid giving battle, his camp was forced by our army
with no small labour; when it pleased God, who
knows how just is our cause, to give us victory. The
said King of France is taken, and the Prince of
Béarn, Seigneur d'Albret, with many other principal
nobles. The Admiral of France, M. de la Trimouille,
and M. de la Palice are killed, with numberless others
of equal note, so that all the chief nobles present at
the battle are either taken or slain. The loss of the
French, we are informed, amounts to 16,000 men,
while we on our side have lost only 400. We have
given, and do give thanks to our Lord for this
victory; and we hope that it may conduce to universal
peace throughout Christendom, which is a thing we
have always desired, and still desire. Remember to
avail yourself of the knowledge of these matters
which Don Alonzo Enriques de Guzman possesses,
who is the bearer of this letter, and a gentleman of
our household; for we know that this news will give
you pleasure, even as it pleases us to hear good
tidings of you. Most serene and very excellent king,
our dear and much-loved brother and cousin, may the
Holy Trinity have you in special keeping.</p>

On the 30th of March Queen Katharine sent her
congratulations to her nephew from Greenwich:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'I have charged the ambassadors of the king, my
husband and master, now going to Spain, to inform
your Highness of the great pleasure and content
I have experienced at hearing of the very signal
victory which God Almighty, by His infinite mercy,
has been pleased to grant to the imperial arms in
Italy, trusting that your Highness will offer thanksgiving
to that same God, as the king, my master, is
now doing, ordering solemn processions and other
religious acts, throughout this kingdom.</p>

<p>'As the king, my husband and master, has never
failed to be the constant and faithful ally of your
Highness&mdash;as his words and deeds have sufficiently
testified on every occasion&mdash;and as from the continuance
of such friendship and alliance the best results
may be anticipated, I humbly beseech your Highness
to persevere in the path of friendship and affection
towards us, since the king has always done his duty
and is now rejoicing at your success. I shall say no
more, but will refer entirely to the said ambassadors,
to whom your Highness will be pleased to give full
credence on my part.&mdash;Greenwich, 30th of March.</p>

<p class="right">'(Signed) Your good aunt, <span class="smcap">Katherina</span>'<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The emperor also received congratulations from
Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and Pope Clement <span class="smcap">VII.</span> On the 31st of
March the king wrote:&mdash;'My most beloved Son,&mdash;This
present letter is to congratulate you upon your
recovery, as also upon the honourable victory which
our Lord has been pleased to grant to your arms,
having vanquished and taken prisoner the French
king, our common enemy....' The letter is signed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
'C'est de la main de votre père, frère, et cousin, et
bel oncle, <span class="smcap">Henry</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Just before the battle of Pavia Margaret had sent
ambassadors to England with instructions to try and
persuade King Henry to send substantial help to the
imperial troops, which were badly in need of money,
suggesting that an attack might now be made on
France during the absence of the king in Italy.
Margaret concludes her instructions by proposing
that the Princess Mary (who was only nine years
old) should be sent to Spain with an increased dowry,
and placed under the emperor's care until old enough
to be married. The ambassadors are told to add
'that madame and the legate (Wolsey) having already
been match-makers in two different cases, there is no
reason for not promoting this one. She herself desires
this marriage more than any other thing whatsoever,
and will leave nothing undone that can bring it about.'<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Wolsey replied to these requests by stating that
the king, his master, was quite ready to cross the
Channel into France under the following conditions:
1st. That madame (Margaret) should provide
3000 horse and 3000 foot. 2nd. That the army
should enter France by way of Normandy. 3rd.
The emperor should procure sufficient money to keep
up his Italian army, etc., etc. But when the envoys
stated that 200,000 ducats, which the emperor was
sending to his army in Italy, had fallen into the
hands of the enemy, the cardinal replied, that if
madame agreed to make remittances of 50,000 crowns,
the king would contribute an equal sum, to which the
envoys answered: 'Madame has not the means to do
that; nobody will lend her money, though she is
willing, for the stipend of the said 3000 horse and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
3000 foot, to sell or pawn her own rings and jewels.'
Respecting the delivery of Princess Mary, the cardinal
said 'that she was too young, and that the
English looked upon her as the treasure of the kingdom,
and that no hostages were sufficient security for
her.'<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> But soon after the small princess was made
to send a fine emerald to the emperor with a message
that when they married she would be able to know
by the clearness or otherwise of the jewel 'whether
his Majesty do keep himself as continent and chaste
as, with God's grace, she will.' The emperor being
twenty-five, whilst his little fiancée was only nine, the
cases were hardly similar; and three months later
Charles had engaged himself to marry his cousin,
Isabella of Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>A council was held in Spain in order to decide
what was to be done with King Francis, in which the
Duke of Alva suggested the most exorbitant terms
as the price of the king's freedom. The Bishop of
Osma pleaded for more generous treatment, but the
duke's advice prevailed, and Francis was offered the
most humiliating terms, which he indignantly rejected,
but finally agreed to the proposals that he
should marry the emperor's sister Eleanor, the
Dowager-Queen of Portugal, and settle the duchy
of Burgundy upon the issue of the marriage; that he
should pardon Bourbon, restore the whole of his
possessions, giving him his sister, the Duchess of
Alençon, in marriage; pay a large ransom, and
furnish troops to attend the emperor's coronation
in Rome.</p>

<p>Francis was sent to Genoa and thence to Spain in
charge of Lannoy, Viceroy of Naples, to the indignation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
of Bourbon and Pescara, who both hoped to
have had the honour of escorting the royal prisoner
to Madrid.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Spain Charles sent a courteous
letter to Louise of Savoy, who was acting as regent
during her son's absence. Louise in reply says:
'Monseigneur! By the letter which it has pleased you
to write to me, I have learned the arrival of monseigneur
the king, my son, in your country, and the
goodwill and good disposition you entertain to treat
him well, for which I know not how sufficiently to
express to you my thanks and gratitude, humbly
beseeching you, sir, to continue to act in this liberal
manner, which so well befits your greatness and
magnanimity. As for the rest, monseigneur, in pursuance
of what you have required of me, I have
given a safe conduct to your courier, desiring to do
your pleasure in this and all other things, as I would
for the said monseigneur, my son, the king, and this
the Lord knows, whom I pray to give you a good and
long life.&mdash;Your most humble <span class="smcap">Loyse</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>On June the 25th, 1525, Charles wrote a long
letter to his brother Ferdinand from Toledo, in which
he says: 'As to the movement of the Lutherans, and
the evil they have done, and to all appearance mean
to do, it has annoyed, and does continue to annoy me
bitterly. If it were in my power to remedy it speedily,
I would spare neither my person nor my estates in
the cause, but you see the difficulty there is in it,
especially since I hope to be in Italy so soon, in order
to take possession of my crowns<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> as I have already
written you word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
'When that is done, I mean to exert all my power
in the extermination of this said sect of Lutherans....'
Charles goes on to say, in answer to his brother's
request that he would use his influence to get him
(Ferdinand) elected King of the Romans, that for
the present the matter had better be kept secret
until he had been crowned emperor, as the electors
'would probably allege, and with truth, that at present
I am myself, in fact, no more than King of the
Romans, and that on this account the election of
another ought to be deferred....</p>

<p>'The King of France is now here. I have caused
him to be placed in the castle of Patina, where he
will be well treated. He has offered me certain
articles of peace, which I send you a copy of, and has
promised to do still better. I will let you know the
result; and if it tends to my honour and advantage,
and to the preserving of my friends, I will follow your
advice in coming to terms, well knowing that it
would be very propitious to my interests to make
peace before I leave this for Italy. If the said peace
cannot be concluded, I shall order the said King
of France to be kept here in all safety, and will
deliberate on the subject of a war for next year....</p>

<p>'In order to leave these kingdoms under good
government, I see no other remedy than to marry
the Infanta Donna Isabella of Portugal, since the
Cortes of the said kingdoms have required me to propose
myself for such a union, and that on his part the
King of Portugal offers me a million of ducats, most
of them to be paid at once, in order to assist in
defraying the expenses of our said journey to Italy.
Were this marriage to take place, I could leave the
Government here in the person of the said Infanta,
who should be provided with a good council, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
there would be no apparent cause to fear any new
movement.'<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>On the 31st of July Charles again writes to Ferdinand:
'As to the affairs of my marriage in Portugal,
it remains in the same state as when I last
wrote to you, waiting for the consent of England,
as also for your advice on the subject. Besides,
it is right that before my departure, I should
know whether I shall have peace or war; and
seeing that there is every hope of the said peace
being concluded, only that time is requisite for it,
I have settled to put off my Italian journey till next
March or April. Thus I shall have time enough
to be married in September, by which arrangement
also I shall be able to receive the said consent, and
your advice, and to ascertain the fact or failure of
the said peace.'<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The following letter from Charles to Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>,
breaking off his marriage with Princess Mary, and
giving all his reasons for so doing, is a most interesting
diplomatic document. It is a pity that King
Henry's answer has, as far as we know, not been
preserved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'My good Father and Brother,&mdash;I had ordered
Peñalosa to tell you what you must since have heard
through your ambassadors at this my Court, who
have likewise delivered your message to me. My
answer to them has been that no alliance in the whole
of Christendom could give me more pleasure than
yours, not only owing to the great friendship which
has existed of old between our royal houses, but on
account of the great affection and love which you
have shown me, whenever we have met together. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
believe that my sentiments are well known to you, and
I can assure you that my affection has not diminished
in the least, but, on the contrary, is daily increasing,
so as to become in time an almost indissoluble tie
betwixt two brothers.</p>

<p>'You must know as well as I do the disasters and
public calamities which this present war has brought
on the Christian world at large, and on the empire
in particular, and the great lack there is of appropriate
remedy. To the cure of those evils it is my
intention to apply myself entirely, since I am duly
bound to do so; but I find one great obstacle in my
way. You are aware of the great evils and disasters
which my absence from these kingdoms once caused,
owing to my not having been able to make such
provision as was needed for the government of this
country. In consequence whereof my subjects are
pressingly requesting me to marry a princess who
may fill my place, and govern during my absence,
which is, in my opinion, the only way to keep them
contented, and enable me to go about freely, and
attend to my personal affairs. The only remedy I
see for this difficulty, and for many others&mdash;which to
so poor a writer as myself would take too much time
to describe&mdash;is to anticipate the time of my said
marriage, and likewise the payment of the sums
to be allotted as the princess's dower. But as your
ambassadors here have positively declared to me, in
your name, that this expedient can nowise be adopted,
nor the said marriage effected until the conclusion of
a solid and lasting peace, I see no way to obviate
the said difficulties, and ward off the impending
evils. I hope you will be reasonable enough to
appreciate at its due value the answer I have just
given to your ambassadors, and will consider it as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
both just and expedient in the present state of my
affairs. As to the continuance of our mutual friendship,
on that point there is not the least danger. I
can assure you there is nothing I desire so much,
being of opinion that, although the form and terms
of our alliance might be altered through my marrying
in another quarter, yet our amity is to continue the
same as ever, and so to be increased as to secure
the mutual and lasting alliance which would have
ensured from my union with the princess, your
daughter. The better to accomplish the said object,
and provide for our common interest, thereby promoting
the welfare of Christendom at large, I
propose that you and I should work together for
the conclusion of a durable peace, likely to turn
to our own mutual advantage and profit, so as to
satisfy our consciences and discharge our duty
towards God as Christian princes; and if, through
our enemy's fault, the said peace should not be made,
to devise together such means as may ensure the
fulfilment of our common wishes, and the satisfaction
of our claims.</p>

<p>'If, therefore, owing to the above-named reasons,
I were obliged to marry (another princess), I beg
you not to take it in bad part, or suffer it to be the
cause of our mutual love and affection being lessened,
for I can assure you that I shall wait for your
answer, and delay as much as possible the said marriage;
and that when the ambassadors receive your
powers and communicate your wishes to me, you will
be convinced of my goodwill and desire to foster and
increase our mutual amity, and to procure your
welfare as much as my own. And that you may
trust to the sincerity of my professions I hereby
affix my signature as a proof of my constant wish to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
be for ever your good son, brother, nephew and good
friend.</p>

</div>

<p>We do not know how King Henry received the
above communication, but soon after, the news reached
Margaret that he was thinking of entering into an
alliance with France. This she foresaw would probably
lead to another war, and at once prepared to
put the Netherlands into a state of defence. She
summoned the States, and again begged for 100,000
florins. The States refused to grant her request,
saying the country had been drained to the uttermost,
and commerce was at a standstill. But Margaret
would not give in, and the States were
convoked again at Gertruydenberg. The Count of
Hochstrate, as head of the council of finance, going
from town to town trying, by coaxing and promises,
to raise the desired sum.</p>

<p>Louise of Savoy now sent her secretary, Viardi, to
Brussels to persuade Margaret to arrange a truce of
six months in order to give her time to treat for the
king's ransom and conclude a peace. Margaret
listened favourably to Viardi's mission, and commanded
the Count of Hochstrate, the Archbishop
of Palermo, and the Count of Berg to meet him at
Breda, where a truce was arranged in Henry of
Nassau's palace. Charles does not appear to have
been consulted as to the terms of this armistice, and,
much annoyed, he sent the following sharp rebuke to
his aunt:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'Madame, my good Aunt!&mdash;I have received your
letters by Richard, and quite approve what you were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
able to communicate to him in what your memory
served you.</p>

<p>'I have received also a copy of the treaty of cessation
of hostilities, which you have concluded. But I
cannot conceal from you, madame, that I have found
it very strange, and very far from satisfactory, that
this should have been done without knowing my
intentions, and without receiving instructions on this
behalf, and powers from me. I have found it convenient,
both for the advantage of my affairs and the
preservation of my authority as heretofore, to declare
to the ambassadors of England, and still more to
those of France, that since the said treaty has been
entered into without instructions and powers from
me, I shall neither acknowledge it, nor ratify it, nor
cause it to be observed.</p>

<p>'Before the arrival of the said Richard, I was
already in communication on the subject of a cessation
of hostilities in all my kingdoms and countries
generally, which I consider much more suitable than
any partial or particular arrangement, and have just
concluded a treaty, with the participation and consent
of the said ambassadors of England (as principal
contracting parties jointly with myself), wherein the
articles are much more to my honour than they were
in yours. In fact, there are two points in the latter
so ill-advised as to condemn the whole. You bring
forward England alone as an ally (as does also the
Duke of Cleves), and promise to offer no assistance
to the enemies of France, which is directly in contradiction
with the treaties in force with England, and
tending to call forth war against Spain and other of
my states, in which case you become incapable of
offering any assistance whatever. Thus the ambassadors
of England know very well how to pretend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
that they cannot escape from the position in which
they would be placed, which is in fact as much, or
more, to my disadvantage than theirs; and as to the
French, they may fairly say that all which has been
demanded has been granted them.</p>

<p>'I am quite sure that this great error, madame, is
not arising from any oversight of yours, and that you
have been led to understand that there was some
necessity for it; at the same time I am very far from
being satisfied with those who have allowed themselves
to proceed in this matter without my command,
and who have presumed to counsel you on subjects of
such grave importance as ought never to be treated
of without my knowledge and approval.</p>

<p>'Madame! I send you a copy of the cessation of
hostilities concluded here, in order that you may cause
it to be published duly, and at the time therein declared,
and to be strictly kept and performed according
to its form and tenor, setting aside your own as null
and void, as well as the publications which may have
taken place; for it is my express intention that it
should not be held of the smallest force or value;
insomuch that if I had not even concluded a treaty,
as aforesaid, here, I would not have permitted yours
to be carried into effect.</p>

<p>'Madame! may our Lord have you in His holy
keeping. Written at Toledo, the 13th of August.</p>

<p class="p2">'Further, madame, ... I have ratified the neutrality
of Burgundy, as you desire, and I have included you,
as well as my brother the archduke and all your
country and subjects, in the treaty for the cessation
of hostilities, which has been here negotiated; and in
all I may be able to do for you, for your affairs and
your welfare, I shall always and most willingly do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the same for you, my good mother and aunt, as for
myself, praying God to give you all your heart's
desire. Written at Toledo, the 15th of August
1525.'<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p2">We can imagine how much upset Margaret must
have been at receiving this severe rebuke which was
called forth by the report that the emperor had just
received from his ambassadors in London giving an
account of an interview they had had with Wolsey,
in which he expressed great surprise and annoyance
at the truce which Margaret had just concluded with
France. 'The treaties of Windsor stipulated,' he
said, 'that neither of the contracting parties was to
conclude a truce without the consent and full approval
of the other one. We have so far adhered to this,
that, though the king has been often solicited by the
French, he has never given his consent to it.... I
should never have thought that, after so many stipulations,
promises, and declarations made by madame,
she would have been the first to break through
them.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'... Any plans and designs which the emperor,
Mons. de Bourbon, and the king, my master, may
have formed in this particular matter are ruined for
ever through madame having granted this truce to
our common enemy.</p>

<p>'... In fact, I do not know how I shall be able
to appease the king's anger when he hears of it, for
he has always maintained that madame was incapable
of doing anything in this matter without letting him
know first. The perplexity and doubt by which
madame is said to be assailed, and which have
induced her to take this step, are no excuse for her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
acting thus; for she ought first to have consulted
the king, my master, and stated her reasons, instead
of deciding, as she has done, for herself,
and then sending an agent to acquaint him with her
resolution, which was by no means an honourable
proceeding....'<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Margaret's reply to her nephew explaining her
reasons for her conduct has unfortunately not been
preserved, but she evidently found means to soothe
his anger, for ere long they were again on the best
of terms. Charles was genuinely devoted to his aunt
and held her in the highest esteem, and to the end
of her life Margaret enjoyed his full confidence, and
was always consulted by him on every occasion of
importance.</p>

<p>King Francis had been brought to Spain in June,
but it was not until August that he was removed
from Valencia and its neighbourhood to Madrid.
On his arrival in the latter town he was bitterly
disappointed to learn that the emperor was away
hunting in Segovia, for he had hoped much from a
personal interview and his own powers of persuasion.
Although comfortably lodged and treated with every
mark of respect, the unaccustomed life of seclusion
soon told on his health, and the report spread that
he was dangerously ill. On hearing of his illness his
sister Margaret, Duchess of Alençon, hastened to
Spain, provided with full powers from her mother,
the regent, to treat for peace. On the evening of
September the 18th Charles was out hunting when
he received the news that the French king was dying.
Immediately he set out for Madrid, and without
hardly drawing rein he rode straight to the Alcazar.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Francis was asleep when he arrived, but the emperor
waited until his prisoner awoke, and then as the
invalid slowly raised himself, exclaiming, 'Here I am,
my lord emperor, your servant and your slave!'
courteously replied, 'Not so; you are my good friend
and brother, and I hope that you will always be so.'
He begged Francis to keep up his spirits, and only
to think of getting well: saying 'that when his sister
the Duchess of Alençon arrived, peace and liberty
would soon follow, for he only asked for what was
reasonable, and did not doubt that Francis would do
what was just.'<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The next day Charles paid the
king another visit, and was equally kind and considerate,
leaving him very much improved in health.
As the emperor descended the stairs from the invalid's
room, he met the Duchess of Alençon, who had just
arrived, and after warmly greeting her, conducted
her to her brother. The Duchess Margaret was a
very attractive, graceful woman, and Charles had
been warned by his Ministers not to receive her, for
as they said, 'Being young and a widow she comes
... to see and to be seen,' and they feared that the
emperor might fall in love with her; but though
Charles kissed her and had private interviews, not
all her charms could make him relax one point in his
conditions of her brother's release. After many
fruitless efforts and endless discussions Margaret was
obliged to return to France without having secured
the much-desired peace. On the 19th of November
1525 Perrenot de Granvelle<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> wrote a long letter to
Margaret of Austria from Toledo, giving her an
account of the Duchess of Alençon's visit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'Madame!... In fulfilment of your wishes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
in accordance with the good pleasure of the emperor,
... I forthwith went to take your letters to the
king (Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>), and on your part to pay him a
visit. I had long audiences with him, at four different
times after the fever had subsided, when I found him
in a good disposition to receive me, though extremely
weak from the severity of his malady. He told me
that he and his kingdom were much indebted to you,
madame, for the desire you had manifested for peace,
and a good intelligence and amity between the
emperor and him, and consequently for his deliverance;
which, if God should please to grant, he must
always esteem you, even as a second mother, with
whose advice and counsel he should be happy to
govern his affairs; adding many other fair and
courteous expressions. On this subject and his ardent
desire for peace, as well as for the friendship and
good graces of the emperor, he spoke much, devising
at large the means of effecting it, and always recurring
to the idea of a marriage as the principal
thing to build upon. He also repeated his assurances
of the desire he had to contribute to the aggrandisement
of the emperor, and to assist in forwarding all
his enterprises, referring all the means and details to
the aforesaid Madame d'Alençon.... Madame! I
met on my journey the said lady, and delivered to
her your letters; and whilst I had this opportunity,
with the knowledge and will of the emperor, I went
to visit her, and have reason to think that I gave
satisfaction without any cause of distrust on the one
side or the other.</p>

<p>'Madame! I have since recovered the copy of the
letter which the emperor had written to M. de Praet,
and of other writings which I now send, as a summary
of the communications which here took place. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the commencement, the said lady recapitulated the
proposition which had already been entertained respecting
the marriage, the ransom, or the cession of
the duchy (of Burgundy) on condition that it should
be pronounced by the Parliament of Paris a possession
belonging of right to the king, who would be
ready to give hostages in this case, to ensure its
surrender. On this point, however, the emperor
declared, as he had before done, without any reference
to the marriage, that no ransom would satisfy him,
nothing less than the duchy, his ancient heritage,
the foundation of his order, of which he bore the
name and arms, rejecting the conditions attached to
it as wholly inadmissible. Some days afterwards,
the said lady made a proposition to the emperor, who
went to visit her at her lodgings, to choose arbitrators,
which he had before refused, and which he then, as
she told me the same day, was ready to agree to.
Afterwards, however, when she was in conference
with the ambassadors, they came to a standstill when
they touched on the aforesaid condition relating to
the Parliament of Paris, and the hostages which the
emperor, they maintain, would not accept.... Communications
have passed in writing on both sides, of
which the result has been nothing more than is above
related. They have now taken their leave, both the
Duchess of Alençon and the ambassadors, declaring
that the king has fully made up his mind not to
resign the said duchy except on the condition already
proposed, choosing rather to submit to perpetual
imprisonment; and this very day the said lady has
sent to demand her passports, that she may return to
France under the same security as she travelled
hither, which has been granted her. No further
movements or proposals have since taken place, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
emperor continuing in the same determination to
obtain possession of the duchy; and if the said lady
takes her departure, as appears her intention, the
hope of peace which has been excited by her arrival,
and the subsequent attempts at negotiation, as well
as by the arbitration supposed to be agreed on, will
altogether vanish for the present.</p>

<p>'Madame! On Sunday last, the 15th of this month,
I received by Richard the letters and other papers
which you were pleased to send me. The emperor
was at that time on a hunting expedition five leagues
hence, with a few attendants, having previously taken
leave of the Duchess of Alençon; and on his return
I presented to him your letters. I discussed with
him at length the two principal points relative to the
peace or truce, and the commercial arrangements in
which your country is concerned.... To all this his
Majesty gave a willing ear, and seemed to take in
good part all that was said....</p>

<p>'Madame! Whatever might have been the opinion
offered, it has certainly come to pass ... that peace
has been made with England, and according to articles
which had been proposed and resolved upon before
the battle and capture of the king.... Among
other causes, it has chiefly arisen, as is pretended,
out of the truce made in your country, as well as
from the correspondence which has passed, and your
frequent declarations, that as far as your interest
was concerned, you had abandoned all thoughts of
war. Concerning this matter I gave a sufficient
explanation, and satisfied his said Majesty, as I hope
thereupon....'<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p2">At last, on the 14th of January 1526, the Treaty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
of Madrid was signed between Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> and
Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>, and the emperor at once wrote to Margaret
to inform her of the joyful news, enclosing a summary
of the treaty. In return for his freedom the French
king agreed to give up the much-coveted duchy of
Burgundy and the counties of Charolais and Hesdin,
to allow the sovereignty of Flanders and other
countries of the emperor within France. To renounce
all claim to Naples, Milan, Genoa, and Asti,
as well as to Tournay and Arras. To reinstate the
Duke of Bourbon in all his property; and set at
liberty the Prince of Orange without any ransom.
It was agreed that all prisoners on both sides should
be liberated; and that the Duke of Gueldres should
be allowed to retain his title during his lifetime, on
condition that at his death his duchy should pass to
the emperor.</p>

<p>The king's marriage with Queen Eleanor of
Portugal was to take place as soon as possible, the
queen bringing 200,000 crowns in gold as her dower,
besides the counties of Macon, Auxerre, and Bar-sur-Seine,
which were to be settled on her and her heirs.
It was especially stipulated that if the king should
be unable to restore Burgundy or carry out other
parts of the treaty, he should again return to captivity,
leaving the Dauphin and his second son as hostages.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>The emperor also wrote to Margaret on the 15th
January asking her to convoke the States-General
for the 22nd of May, to inform them of the peace
that had just been concluded.</p>

<p>But Francis had no intention of keeping the
promises which had been wrung from him under
compulsion, and he secretly resolved to break faith
with the emperor as soon as he regained his liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
A few days after the Treaty of Madrid had been
signed Margaret had the sorrow of losing her niece,
Isabel, the young Queen of Denmark, who died near
Ghent on the 19th of January, at the age of twenty-five,
and was buried in that city. Her life with
Christian <span class="smcap">II.</span> had not been a happy one, and it was
said that she died of a broken heart. Her three
children, John, Dorothea, and Christina,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> she left to
her aunt Margaret's care, 'whom she had always
called her mother.' Margaret nobly fulfilled this
trust, and tenderly watched over the children until
her death. She appointed the learned Cornelius
Agrippa, then residing at her Court, as tutor to
Prince John, who at the time of his mother's death
was only eight years old. In a letter to Ferdinand
Charles thus mentions their sister's death: 'I am
very sorry for the death of our sister the Queen of
Denmark, and have taken care that prayers should
be said for the repose of her soul. I would willingly
recommend to you her children our nephews, who
are at present in the hands of our dear aunt in
Flanders.'</p>

<p>On Ash-Wednesday, the 14th of February, Charles
de Lannoy wrote to Margaret from Madrid to
inform her that the emperor had arrived the day
before, and King Francis had gone outside the city
to meet him. After supper they had spent two
hours talking together, and seemed well pleased with
each other. The king had begged permission to see
Queen Eleanor, which was granted, with the assurance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
that as soon as he set foot in Provence she
should be delivered over to him.</p>

<p>Lannoy goes on to say that he has been ordered
to attend the king on his way to France.</p>

<p>On February the 26th the Abbot of Najera mentions
in a long letter to the emperor that peace had
been proclaimed in Milan on St. Matthew's Day, the
24th of February, which was looked upon as a good
omen as it was the emperor's birthday as well as the
anniversary of the victory of Pavia. But a little
later John Jonglet wrote to Margaret from London
that 'it was publicly asserted that the King of
France would not keep his treaty with the emperor,
as the States-General of his kingdom would never
sanction the dismemberment of his crown.'<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Charles himself seems to have suspected that
Francis might play him false, for, on the 19th of
February, he had written to De Praet that ... 'as
the said Seigneur King (Francis) is bound to deliver
up to us certain hostages, as you will see by this
treaty, we desire that you will well and carefully
inform yourself who the said hostages are to be,
whether the king's two eldest sons, or Monseigneur
the Dauphin, and twelve of the principal nobility ... that
you take especial notice of, and be regardful
of the persons of the three children of France,
that you make yourself thoroughly acquainted with
the visage, physiognomy, size, and person of each,
that when it comes to the delivering of them over
... there may be no trickery in substituting one
person for another, and that you may be able of
a certainty to recognise them as the identical persons
whom we ought to have. Our Viceroy of Naples is
to take the charge of the said delivery and acceptation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
and as you are aware he can have no particular
knowledge himself of the said children, it is a matter
of necessity that you should be well acquainted with
all these particulars....' In another letter to De
Praet he says: 'On Shrove-Tuesday we reached
Madrid, where we had the satisfaction of finding
ourselves with the Sieur King, reciprocally exchanging
such sentiments and good offices as two attached
friends and brothers entertain and exercise together....</p>

<p>'We remained at Madrid Tuesday evening, Wednesday,
and Thursday, and on the following day
departed thence with the said king our brother,
and slept four leagues from Madrid, in order to
reach Illescas, two leagues further, on Saturday.
At Illescas we shall find the queen our sister
(Eleanor). Here they will meet and see each other,
and speak together; and then the king will return
to Madrid, and we shall continue his companion in
the evening. The next day he will begin his journey
direct for Bayonne accompanied by our said viceroy.
Soon afterwards our sister the queen will also set off
for the same, attended by our Constable of Castile.
And as to ourselves, we intend to take the road
towards Seville, where we shall find our empress,
and where our marriage is to take place.'<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>On the 16th of February Charles wrote to Louise
of Savoy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>'Madame, my good Mother,&mdash;Since I have given
back a good brother to the king your son, and am
offering you the queen my sister for a daughter, it
appears to me that, in order not to present you one
son only, I should resume the name which I used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
formerly to give you, and should again address you
as my good mother; and seeing that I do so consider
you, I pray you to act as such towards the said
queen my sister, as well as towards myself. I came
to this town of Madrid to see the king your son ... and
I was sorry not to have been able to do so
sooner, but I am greatly rejoiced at finding both his
health and his affections in so different a state from
what they were when I last saw him. The love and
friendship which he professes to bear towards me
have given me no small satisfaction, and I nowise
doubt the sincerity of these good feelings, which
I hope you will assist in confirming, as you have
promised me by your letters that you would do. On
my part I assure you that the love and friendship I
bear towards him are most sincere, and that I am
fully prepared to accomplish everything I have
promised.</p>

<p>'You request in your said letter that the king ... should
take the queen, his wife, my sister, with him.
As soon as the king ... has ratified and sworn to
the treaties, and that all things are concluded between
him and me, she shall be given up at Bayonne according
to your desire. This shall be done by my Viceroy
of Naples after he has liberated the king ... and
has received the hostages that are to be given.</p>

<p>'And now, madam, that he may no longer distress
you by his bad writing, he who looks upon you as
his good mother will conclude by recommending
himself with all his heart to your kindness, and
will sign himself,&mdash;Your good son,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Charles</span><a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>'To Madame the Regent of France, my good mother.'</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">From the emperor's Itinerary we learn that Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Eleanor left off her mourning on being affianced to
the King of France. On her arrival at Talavera she
was met by the emperor and the Duke of Bourbon.
On the 20th of February the emperor and the King
of France went together to Illescas, where they paid
a visit to the Queen Eleonora and Queen Germaine
de Foix, accompanied by the Countess of Nassau and
other ladies, who received them on the stairs. They
then went into a saloon, where the four sat down
under a canopy, and were engaged in conversation,
whilst the ladies of the Court amused themselves by
dancing.... On the 23rd of February the emperor
took leave of his sister, the Queen of France, who
remained at Illescas, and pursued his journey towards
Seville, where the Princess Isabella of Portugal, his
affianced bride, was to meet him on the 9th of March.
He made his entry into Seville on that day, and on
the 10th his marriage was celebrated with much
pomp. At the magnificent festivities which followed,
it is recorded that M. de la Chaux opened
the ball.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>In a letter to his brother Ferdinand, Charles thus
briefly refers to his wedding: 'I have now entered
upon the estate of marriage, which pleases me well.'
And yet this marriage, begun under such unromantic
conditions, turned out very happily, for Isabella was
a capable princess, who, besides her beauty and clear
complexion, had a good heart and sound judgment,
and Charles, we are told, 'lived in perfect harmony
with her, and treated her on all occasions with much
distinction and regard.'</p>

<p>Guillaume des Barres, one of Margaret's secretaries,
sent his mistress the following description of
the bride: 'I would give much that you could see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
her, for if you have been told of her many beauties,
virtues, and goodness, you would find still more, and
you should see how happy they are together.'<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> On
April 26th, 1526, Margaret sent an embassy to Spain
to congratulate Charles on his marriage, and present
her good wishes to the empress, to whom she wrote,
'that she wished that things could be so arranged
that she could come and visit the countries over here
(Flanders), which are so beautiful and adorned with
such fine towns....'<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Amongst other things her
ambassador was ordered to tell the emperor 'that
the archduchess had the greatest pleasure in trying
to extirpate the sect of the Lutherans,' and on his
own account he added that his mistress lived so
simply and economically that there was no chancellor
of a province, nor sub-governor or lieutenant in the
country, who lived as simply as she did.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the 17th of March, King Francis
had been set at liberty. Charles in a letter to his
brother says: 'The King of France was restored to
his kingdom on the 17th of this month (February),
on my receiving the Dauphin and Duke of Orleans
as hostages, whom I have desired to be taken to
Burgos; and the said King of France promises to
accomplish all that he has engaged in by the treaty
of peace....'</p>

<p>Guicciardini gives the following interesting account
of the exchange of prisoners at Fuenterrabia: 'By
this time the French king was come to Fuenterrabia,
a town appertaining to the emperor, standing near
the Ocean Sea upon the frontiers of Biscay and the
duchy of Guyenne; and on the other side the Lady
Regent was arrived with the children of France at
Bayonne, which is not far from Fuenterrabia....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Then the 18th day of March, the French king,
accompanied by the viceroy, Captain Alarçon, with
fifty horse, came to the shore of the river that
divideth the realm of France from the kingdom of
Spain; at the same time M. de Lautrech, with the
king's children, and the like number of horse, presenting
themselves on the other side. There was in the
midst of the river a great barque made fast with
anchors, in which was no person. The king approached
to this barque in a little boat, wherein he
was accompanied by the viceroy, etc.... all armed
with short weapons, and on the other side of the
barque were likewise brought in a little boat, M. de
Lautrech, with the hostages ... after this the
viceroy went into the barque ... and the king
with him.... M. de Lautrech fetched out of the
boat into the barque the Dauphin, who being given
to the viceroy ... was forthwith bestowed in his
boat, and after him followed the little Duke of
Orleans, who was no sooner entered the barque than
the French king leaped out of the barque into his
boat with such swiftness that his permutation was
thought to be done at one self instant, and then the
king being brought to the shore, mounted suddenly
(as though he had feared some ambush) upon a
Turkish horse of a wonderful swiftness, which was
prepared for the purpose, and ran without stay to
St. John de Luz, a town of his obedience, four
leagues from thence; and being there readily relieved
with a fresh horse, he ran with the same swiftness to
Bayonne, where he was received with incredible joy
of all the Court.'<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>In a despatch to the emperor, written on March
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
23rd, Ochoa de Ysasaga announced that 'The day
that the King of France was released from his
captivity he leaped from the boat, with water up to
his knees, mounted a horse that had been prepared
for him, and rode without stopping to St. Jean de
Luz, where he dined, and was visited by the flower
of the French nobility, who came to congratulate
him.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>And thus Charles let slip his chance, and omitted
to reap the fruitful August, which Lannoy, in
announcing the victory of Pavia, had declared
comes to a man once and once only in his life.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE LADIES' PEACE</h3>

<p class="p2">The eventful year 1526 was not to close without
further troubles for the House of
Austria. The Sultan Solyman, taking advantage
of the war in Italy and the consequent
absorption of the principal rulers of Europe, had
pushed his conquests in the east until his vast hosts
encamped before the walls of Vienna. Louis <span class="smcap">II.</span>,
King of Hungary, who had married Margaret's niece
Mary, seeing his kingdom thus invaded by the Turks,
sent urgent appeals for help to all Christian princes.
But either the neighbouring powers were too much
occupied with their own affairs, or they did not
realise the actual danger, for they returned cold and
indifferent answers, and even the emperor delayed
sending aid to his brother-in-law until too late. On
the 29th of August a decisive battle was fought on
the plains of Mohacs between the Hungarian army
and the troops of Solyman, and ended in the utter
defeat of King Louis, who before the day was over
lost his crown and his life. Two months after, his
body and that of his horse was found sunk in a bog,
into which he had ridden during the retreat. His
next heir was his sister Anne, who had married
Margaret's nephew, the Archduke Ferdinand. And
it was in right of his wife that a few months later
Ferdinand was elected to the thrones of Bohemia and
Hungary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
An interesting correspondence between Margaret
and her nephew Ferdinand gives full details of these
stirring events. On the 18th of September Ferdinand
wrote to Margaret from Lintz:&mdash;'Madame, my good
Aunt,&mdash;The news has just reached me that the Turk
with two hundred thousand men met the King of
Hungary, my late brother-in-law, about twenty miles
from Buda, where he was with forty thousand men to
defend his country. On the 29th of August last he
gave battle, which (battle) was won by the Turk, and
all the late king's large quantity of artillery was
destroyed and he himself slain, some say whilst fighting,
others, that seeing the said battle was lost, he
retreated, and thinking to escape, entered a morass,
where he remained, which seems most probable.
Thus, madame, you can imagine how perplexed I am
to be deprived of money and help against such a formidable
power as the said Turk.... To-day news
has reached me that the said Turk has taken the
town of Buda and that he has despatched two of his
principal captains, each with a good number of men,
one to invade my country of Austria ... and the other
to do the same in Styria, which they have already
begun to do, and have gone within fifteen or sixteen
miles of Vienna. And you ought, madame, as a good
lady and experienced princess, to help the emperor,
my lord and brother, to make peace with our common
enemies to his greater honour and safety, as soon as
possible ... and diligently make every effort to
repulse this cursed Turk, which I very humbly beg
you to do, for if his Majesty does not quickly find
a remedy, not only I, our House of Austria, and all
Germany will fall into complete ruin and desolation,
but also the whole of Christianity....</p>

<p>'As to the affairs in Italy, they are, madame, also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
in a very bad way, owing to the enemies' great power
and our insufficient number of men.... I have sent
Messire George de Fronsberg ... to Augsbourg with
the best jewels and rings that I have ... for, madame,
I neither have or know of other means to raise money
to send help ... so you can imagine to what poverty
I am reduced.... And at present I do not know of
anything else worthy to write to you about, excepting
to beg you, madame, very humbly to send some
help and succour if you can ... for I am so much in
need of money, without which I can do nothing,
because of the great expenses I have had since I came
to Germany.... And it may be that for lack of help
and succour you may soon have the same news
of me as of the late King of Hungary. And as to the
queen, my sister, she is about ten miles from Vienna,
very unhappy and desolate, as you may imagine. I
have sent for her consolation and also for her safety
some good people and some infantry.... I will inform
you of anything more that occurs....' Then
follows a postscript in Ferdinand's handwriting:
'Madame, je vous suplie vouloir tenir la main à la
pais; car vous voyés bien que c'est plus que besoin.'<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Margaret replied: 'My good Nephew,&mdash;I have
received your two letters, one of the 18th and the
other of the 23rd September, and by them have
heard of the sad and pitiable news of the death of
the King of Hungary, the loss of the kingdom, and
the state of the poor queen, your sister, my good
niece, and above all, the danger which you, your
country and subjects are in. I do not know how to
express to you the regret and sorrow that I feel, and
you can believe that it is not less than if the misfortune
had befallen me, and that I was in the position
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
of the queen, your worthy sister, or yourself. In
any case it becomes us to conform in all things to the
will of God, our Creator, the refuge and consoler of
the desolate, who never forsakes or abandons those
who pray to Him with their whole heart....</p>

<p>'I have ordered your courier in Zealand to cross
the sea with the first good company that leaves, which
is the safest way, and I have written to the emperor
reminding him of your conduct and the services you
have rendered him, exhorting and imploring him first
to assist you in your great and extreme necessity, as
I hope he will, and on my part in this and other
matters I will do what I can for you and your service.
John Seigneur de Temstel, whom Monseigneur de
Bourbon sent to you, and also Messire George de
Fronsberg have been to see me and told me that the
said Messire George has not been able to raise money
from the Fuggers or others on the rings you gave
him ... for which I am sorry. I have informed
the King of England and the legate of the loss of
Hungary and the death of the king.... Monseigneur,
if it should happen that you should see the
Queen of Hungary, your sister, or ... that you should
send or write to her, I beg you to recommend me to
her, and console her for her misfortune as much as
is possible, and comfort her and forward a letter which
I have written to her.... I beg you, monseigneur,
to often send me your news, and I will send you mine
from here, and assist you in every way in my power,
with the help of our Lord.'<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Ferdinand also received a sympathetic letter from
Charles, in which the emperor said that 'he could not
well express his grief on hearing of the misfortunes
and death of King Louis of Hungary, and at first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
could not believe the news, although it reached him
from various parts.... When his (Ferdinand's) letter
arrived he had already sent his last penny to Italy,
and was therefore unable immediately to send help,
but he had done his best to procure money, and would
shortly send 100,000 ducats in bills by a gentleman of
his bedchamber, whom he was sending on a mission to
him and their sister Mary with instructions to carry out
his (Ferdinand's) wishes in every respect, and hoped
that the archduke's affairs would soon be satisfactorily
settled....'<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>On the 17th of December Queen Mary announced
that her brother, the Archduke Ferdinand, had been
duly elected King of Hungary and Bohemia on the
16th by all the barons and nobles present at the Diet.
When Charles heard this welcome news he at once
sent to congratulate his brother and thanked the
States for the part they had taken in his election,
promising 'to spend all his treasures and all his blood
in their defence.'<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>But other important events now claimed the emperor's
attention. Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> had no sooner gained
his liberty than he deliberately evaded his promises
and refused to ratify the Treaty of Madrid. On May
the 22nd, 1526, he entered into an alliance with the
Pope, Venice, the Duke of Milan, and Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>
This League of Cognac had for its ostensible object
the peace of Christendom, but in reality aimed at expelling
the emperor from his possessions in Italy, and
checking his growing power. As soon as the treaty
was concluded, Clement <span class="smcap">VII.</span> absolved Francis from the
oath he had taken to observe the Treaty of Madrid
on the plea that he had acted under compulsion.
When the emperor discovered that the King of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
France intended to break faith and elude his most
solemn promises, his wrath knew no bounds, and he
publicly denounced Francis as a prince without faith
or honour, at the same time accusing the Pope of base
ingratitude. To these reproaches Francis replied by
challenging the emperor to single combat, but this
interesting duel was not allowed to take place. The
peace for which Margaret had 'grandement tenu la
main' was broken, and war broke out again fiercer
than ever.</p>

<p>The North Italian towns made overtures to the
French, and the imperial troops received a decided
check in Lombardy. Money was very scarce, and,
worried on every side, Charles grumbled that Margaret
showed lack of energy in raising funds, and
reproached her for not squeezing more out of the
Netherlands. To his other troubles was added the
knowledge that Lutheranism was making enormous
strides in the Belgian provinces. Margaret's attitude
towards the reformers showed great moderation considering
the irritation she felt against those sects who
added religious dissension to the troubles of a foreign
war. She was convinced that overmuch zeal on the
part of the orthodox could only do harm, and addressed
a circular letter to all religious houses within her
jurisdiction, recommending that only wise, tactful,
and enlightened orators should be allowed to preach,
and advising them always to speak gravely and prudently,
and never mention either the reformers or their
doctrine. She also forbade all meetings where the
divine office was reduced to only the reading of the
Bible. 'These meetings,' she said, 'aim at alienating
the people from the reverence due to the sacraments,
to the honour which belongs to the Mother of
God and the Saints, to prayers for the dead, fasting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
and other precepts of the Church.' She imposed
various fines on those who were convicted before
a magistrate of reformed practices&mdash;twenty francs for
a first offence, forty for a second, and eighty for a
third. All who were unable to pay were to be
banished. But these measures had no effect, and a
little later a new edict appeared in which it was proclaimed
that in order to check the progress of heresy,
those who possessed books written by Luther or his
followers were to bring them to the governor of the
place, under pain of confiscation of goods, or even
death. Extreme measures were against Margaret's
nature, but circumstances and the spirit of the times
forced her into them.</p>

<p>In May of the following year (1527) she received
the joyful tidings that a son and heir (Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span>) had
been born to Charles on the 22nd at Valladolid. But
in the midst of the rejoicings that followed the infant's
birth came the startling news that Rome had been
taken and sacked by the imperial troops, that the
Constable of Bourbon had fallen whilst leading the
assault, and that the Pope was a prisoner in the
castle of St. Angelo. This astounding information
caused the christening festivities to be brought to an
abrupt conclusion, the emperor ordering instead that
the Court should go into mourning and Bourbon's
obsequies should be celebrated for five days. Charles
expressed himself as horrified at the outrages which
his lawless troops had committed against the Holy
See, and was anxious to disclaim any share in the
tragedy, which he stoutly maintained had been perpetrated
without his knowledge and against his wish.
He even addressed a circular letter to the various
crowned heads, in which he said: 'His soldiers, perceiving
that the Pope had been unfaithful to every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
treaty made with him, were determined to march to
Rome in spite of their generals. Though the excesses
and cruelty of the exasperated soldiery have
not been so great as his enemies chose to represent
at the time, he is still very sorry for what has happened,
and can assure them that he has felt the disrespect of
his troops towards the Apostolic See more than he can
express, and certainly would have much preferred to be
conquered than to conquer under the circumstances.'<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>We can imagine, too, with what horror Margaret
received the news from Rome, and how her compassionate
heart must have bled as she heard the
ghastly tales of murder, rapine, and sacrilege which
had been committed in the sacred city.</p>

<p>On May the 30th the emperor wrote to Mendoza,
his ambassador in England: ' ... We shall not fail
to inform you ... of whatever is being done here
(Valladolid) with regard to the French and English
ambassadors, and their commission. We shall likewise
apprise madame, our aunt, but as the cipher
which you possess is safer than hers, we will use
yours for the purpose of transmitting our orders and
wishes thereupon.... Meanwhile you will write to
madame in our name, that without appearing to
distrust the English in any way, she may, as of her
own accord, immediately provide for the defence of
the frontiers both by sea and land, in Flanders as
well as in Holland and Zealand, and remember what
his Reverence the Legate of England (Wolsey) said
on a previous occasion, that once the Flemish
frontier is broken in upon, the conquest of the land
would be an easy matter. Should madame require
our assistance for the protection of our dominions in
those parts, you will tell her in our name that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
shall do our utmost to provide her with money and
troops for the emergency, and that she is to inform
us, as soon as possible, of the military preparations
she intends making, in doing which madame is to
use your own cipher, of which a copy shall be sent
to her immediately, that she herself may write to us,
if she so prefers.'<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>About this time rumours of the unhappy matrimonial
relations existing between Queen Katharine
and King Henry reached Charles from his ambassador
in England. On the 13th of July Mendoza wrote
from London that ' ... the king and his ministers
were trying to dissolve the marriage between the
queen and himself, alleging that the Pope had no
power to grant a dispensation for the queen to marry
two brothers as she had done.... The emperor
may believe him (Mendoza) that there is so much
feeling expressed here ... about the queen's divorce,
not only on her own account, but because ... her
daughter the princess would be declared illegitimate,
that should six or seven thousand men land on the
coast of Cornwall to espouse the cause of both
mother and daughter, forty thousand Englishmen
would at once join them....'<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>In a sympathetic letter to Queen Katharine on
the 27th of August Charles said:&mdash;'Madame and
my Aunt,&mdash;I have perfectly understood the verbal
message brought by Francisco Phelipez from you
respecting the affair (of the divorce), and the reason
why you sent him to me.... You may well imagine
the pain this intelligence caused me, and how much
I felt for you. I cannot express it otherwise than
by assuring you that were my own mother concerned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
I should not experience greater sorrow than in this
your case, for the love and affection which I profess
to your Serene Highness is certainly of the same
kind as that of a son towards his parent. I have
immediately set about taking the necessary steps for
the remedy, and you may be certain that nothing
shall be omitted on my part to help you in your
present tribulation. But it seems to me that in the
meantime your Serene Highness ought not to take
this thing so much to heart, as to let it impair your
bodily health, for if this is preserved, all other matters
will be remedied with God's help.'<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Early in September of this same year (1527)
Margaret sent a courier to the Spanish Court to
announce the birth of a son and heir to Ferdinand.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
Charles was delighted to receive the news, and at
once sent a letter of congratulation to his brother,
saying 'that he rejoiced more at the birth of his
nephew than at that of his own son Philip.'</p>

<p>Although, after several months' imprisonment in
the castle of St. Angelo, the Pope had at length
come to terms with the emperor, still the war in
Italy dragged on, with many recriminations on all
sides. France and England had joined hands against
Spain, and trade with the Netherlands was at a
standstill. At length, when all Europe was sick of
war and longed for peace, Wolsey suggested to
Margaret that she should use her influence to try
and bring about a better understanding among the
nations, and especially between France and Spain.</p>

<p>On March 12th, 1528, Margaret wrote to her
secretary, Guillaume des Barres, from Malines, instructing
him to 'go with all diligence to London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
to Monsieur de Burgues' (Iñigo de Mendoza, just
appointed Bishop of Burgos),<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> the emperor's ambassador
at that Court, and present his credentials, and
tell him 'that we have received his letter of the 11th
instant and heard of the overtures of peace made by
the legate. We are indeed very happy,' she says,
'to see the good turn the affair is taking. You will
tell him that we shall spare no personal trouble or
fatigue to bring about a general peace, ... though
it seems to us, and indeed to almost all other people
of honest intentions and quick understanding, that
King Francis ought to have accepted at once the
emperor's offers, by recalling his Italian army and
giving up Genoa and his other conquests before his
sons were actually released from captivity.... You
will ... request Mons. de Burgues to acquaint the
legate with our readiness to help towards the
accomplishment of peace, ... that we have sent
you for that purpose, and wish this affair to be conducted
between us without the intervention of any
other person whatsoever ... and,' she adds, 'it is
but proper that he himself (Wolsey) should have the
honour of the affair since the proposal originated
with him.'</p>

<p>A conference was held in London, and at Wolsey's
request Margaret was invited to take in hand the
arrangements for a general peace, and more particularly
one between France and Spain. She was asked
to work at it conjointly with the cardinal. Des
Barres then proceeded to declare his mistress's
intentions and wishes respecting the peace, expatiating
at large on the evils resulting from the war to
Christendom in general, and more particularly to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
dominions and subjects of the emperor and the King
of France, as it afforded the Turk every facility for
an invasion, and encouraged the Lutheran heresy to
spread far and wide. After discussing the subject
at length, Wolsey begged Margaret immediately to
send a messenger by land to the emperor, to acquaint
him as soon as possible with the result of the conference
held with his ambassadors, and the means
which they and he conjointly propose for the furtherance
of peace. The cardinal promised to apply for
a safe conduct through French territory for the
gentleman whom Madame Margaret might choose
to appoint.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>About this time Margaret seems to have conceived
the idea that it would be better for the interests of
all concerned if the arrangements for the peace were
made by ladies only, and she accordingly proposed to
the emperor that she should meet her sister-in-law
Louise of Savoy at a neutral town and discuss the
conditions with her. In a letter to M. de Rosymboz,
her chief steward, dated Malines, 3rd of January
1529, containing instructions to be laid before the
emperor, Margaret gives her reasons for this suggestion,
and says:&mdash;'First, that the bitterness of the
reproaches written and spoken on either side were
such that ill-will and hatred were the inevitable
consequences. The hostilities also which ensued
were so fierce that neither of the two sovereigns
could compromise his dignity by being the first to
talk of reconciliation, a challenge having been given
and accepted for settling the differences and disputes
by single combat. On the other hand, how easy for
ladies ... to make the first advances in such an
undertaking! Secondly, that it is only by a mutual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
forgiveness of all offences, and the total oblivion of
the causes of the war, and of everything that had
passed in writing concerning them, that the idea
of peace could be entertained. This could not be
thought of or proposed by the princes without a
sacrifice of what they held most precious, their
honour; but ladies might well come forward in a
measure for submitting the gratification of private
hatred and revenge to the far nobler principle of the
welfare of nations. Thirdly, were the King of France
to conduct negotiations with the emperor, it would
be necessary for him to act with especial reference to
allies and co-operators, the Venetians, Florentines,
etc., and here a difficulty would arise in effecting a
reconciliation with the emperor, not to be surmounted
without the probability of some stain upon
his honour; but the act of the Lady of Angoulême,
his mother, would in such case take away all
responsibility on the part of the king, whilst a
similar advantage would present itself to the emperor
in silencing the complaints of his friends, who might
make objections to the terms of peace. Again, in
the event of any of the great powers being called in
as mediators in a negotiation, such as England or the
Pope, their own particular interest it is probable
would be too much considered, and something
perhaps required in little territorial concessions as
the price of their interference; whilst the intervention
proposed could be subject to no such inconvenience;
as the mother of the king and the aunt of
the emperor, who regarded him as her son as well as
heir, would keep in view one sole object which they
had mutually at heart&mdash;the general good of Europe,
in the reconciliation of these two great princes.'<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
To these wise arguments the emperor lent a
willing ear, and invested Margaret with full powers
to treat with Louise of Savoy; and chose the neutral
town of Cambray as their meeting-place.</p>

<p>On May the 15th Margaret wrote to Jehan de la
Sauch from Brussels, whom she had sent on an
embassy to England, bidding him tell King Henry
how often she had been requested by Louise of
Savoy to listen to overtures of peace. She had
informed the emperor of the said overtures through
Rosymboz, her chief steward, and her secretary,
Des Barres, whom she had sent to Spain; and the
emperor, not wishing to be an obstacle to the said
peace, sent her at once full powers to treat with all
Christian princes in general and with King Francis
and his mother in particular. This fact having
been communicated to the Duchess of Angoulême,
measures had been taken to appoint a time and place
wherein the preliminaries of peace might be at once
discussed and settled. 'She has no doubt,' she says,
'that King Henry will be glad to hear the news,
and will help to the utmost of his power in establishing
peace. For her part she need hardly say how
glad she will be to labour for so meritorious a
purpose.' Maistre le Sauch is ordered to return as
soon as possible after delivering his embassy and
report every word the king and Wolsey may say on
this occasion, and also what impression the idea of
the proposed meeting has produced on each of them.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>On May the 26th Margaret wrote a long letter to
the emperor in cipher from Brussels, informing him
that she had, with the advice of her Council, agreed
to meet Louise of Savoy on the 15th of the following
June at Cambray, and there discuss with her the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
preliminaries of a lasting peace, which she (Margaret)
had no doubt would be easily obtained, provided the
French king felt disposed to be as reasonable as the
emperor. She also said it was important to keep
on good terms with the English, as their assistance
would certainly be required with regard to the
indemnity and the debts. And for this end Maistre
Jehan le Sauch has been sent to inform King Henry
of the proposed meeting, stating that nothing shall
be negotiated without his being comprised in it.... Respecting
the emperor's visit to Italy (for his
coronation), the arrangement of which has given
much pleasure to all his faithful vassals and servants,
she hopes that he will provide himself with plenty of
means, money, provisions and men, for money cannot
be procured in Italy, and as to reinforcements from
Germany, it will be next to impossible to procure any
under two or three months' notice.... In short,
all things considered and 'subject to the emperor's
superior wisdom,' her opinion is that the embarkation
ought to be delayed until after the negotiations at
Cambray are concluded, for if the meeting takes
place and is brought to a happy conclusion, the
emperor will be able to carry out his plans at less
cost and with greater chance of success. The French
king being unable to help his allies in Italy, the
Pope and Venetians will soon come to terms, and
everything will turn out well.... She then goes
on to point out the various difficulties that may arise
at the forthcoming conference, and asks for further
instructions from the emperor. In a postscript
written on the following day she adds that a gentleman
from Queen Katharine's household has just
arrived from England with a message that King
Henry has recommenced judicial proceedings for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
his divorce more briskly than before, and Queen
Katharine begs her (Margaret) to send two qualified
persons to England to counsel and help her.
Margaret says that 'she intends sending to Malines
to obtain the opinion of experienced lawyers in that
place; and if the person appointed by the emperor
to replace Don Iñigo (Mendoza) has not yet left
Spain, his departure should be hastened, for the
poor queen is much perplexed, and there is no one
in England who dares take up her defence against
the king's will.'<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>On May the 27th, Wolsey wrote to Margaret
from Richmond thanking her for her letter received
through her secretary, Le Sauch, and informing her
how glad the king was to hear the news of the prospect
of peace. 'As to himself he need hardly say
that he is entirely at her service.' The letter is
addressed to '<i>Madame ma bonne mère</i>,' and signed
'<i>Votre très humble serviteur et filz.</i>'</p>

<p>Early in June Margaret received Le Sauch's report
of his visit to England. On the 23rd of May
he had had a message from Cardinal Wolsey ordering
him to present himself at Windsor on the following
day before the dinner-hour. He was introduced
to the king on the 24th, who made many inquiries
after Madame Margaret's health and her present
place of residence, and asked what news he (Le
Sauch) brought from Flanders. The king then said:
'The news brought by madame's ambassador is very
gratifying to me ... for certainly I am a man of
peace.... You are welcome to my Court; I am
very glad to hear that the emperor is so well disposed
towards peace....' The king also said: 'You
will offer madame our most cordial and affectionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
commendations, and will tell her that we thank her
most earnestly for the good news she has been pleased
to send us ... and nothing shall be left undone on
our part to forward her views, when we have seen
the articles, which will, we presume, be sent for our
inspection before peace is finally concluded.' Le
Sauch then saw the cardinal, who, after likewise expressing
his joy at Margaret's message, said: 'You
ought to remember that last year I confessed to you
that madame was, in my opinion, an excellent princess,
and that something good might in that sense be
expected from her.' After which flattering speech
Le Sauch took his leave, and the next day left London
for Flanders.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of June he sent Margaret an account
of his interview with King Francis and Louise of
Savoy at Chantilly. 'After presenting his respects
to Madame Louise, he was conducted to King Francis,
who asked after Madame Margaret's health and when
she was likely to return to Cambray,' adding that 'it
was his earnest wish to see the present preliminary
negotiations come to an issue that he might himself
see and speak to madame.' After delivering polite
messages from his mistress, Le Sauch informed the
king that she had intended leaving Brussels on the
previous Wednesday or Thursday, and hoped to
arrive at Mons on Saturday, stay there over Sunday,
and go to Valenciennes on Tuesday, and there wait
for news. Le Sauch mentioned that Margaret had
been warned not to go to Cambray for fear of King
Francis taking her prisoner, but that her answer had
been that 'she had no mistrust or fear of any sort as
regarded Madame Louise or the king, and that if any
of her councillors or courtiers were afraid, they might
go home.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
When it was suggested that at least she ought to
have a strong escort sufficient to cope with the
French, and, if required, with the people of the town,
her answer was 'that if she brought one single armed
man in her suite people might imagine she was going
on a warlike enterprise, and not on a work of peace.
She had started on a mission of peace, and hoped,
God willing, to be successful.'</p>

<p>The Duchess of Angoulême then said there was
nothing she desired so much as to see her sister
(Margaret), whom she loved extremely, and cooperate
with her in the establishment of a solid and
lasting peace. She would have come much sooner
had she not been prevented by a severe illness.... She
then told Le Sauch to announce that on Wednesday
next without fail she would be at St. Quentin,
and 'that you, madame, would do well to inform the
emperor of the impediments thrown in her way by
the English and the rest of the Italian confederates.... She
had no objection to make respecting the
arrangements and preparations at Cambray for your
mutual visits, and was glad to hear that your dwelling
and hers were close to each other.'</p>

<p>Le Sauch ends by saying that he hears the meeting
is not likely to take place before the following
Sunday or Monday, for 'it is not likely that the
queen-mother will travel from St. Quentin to Cambray,
a distance of eight leagues, in twenty-four
hours, and most probably she will not stop at Crève-c&oelig;ur.
However ... nothing has yet been officially
announced.'</p>

<p>In another despatch, written on the following day,
he says: 'Madame, the queen and the king, her son,
arrived last evening in this town (Compiègne). The
next day ... I repaired to the apartments of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
queen, who was just going to dinner. I found, however,
means of penetrating into her chamber, and so
contrived that she saw me, beckoned me to approach,
and asked whether I had news of madame. I answered
that I had heard of your departure from
Brussels on Thursday, and that I had been particularly
requested to inform her of the fact, and send
back what news I had of her intended movements.
The queen then observed that she could not well
arrive at St. Quentin before Saturday, and went on
to say: "I depart upon this journey frankly and full
of confidence in my sister (Margaret), sincerely hoping
that our meeting and conference will turn out as I
wish, and that whatever is agreed upon between us
the emperor will approve and ratify. I know not
whether you are aware that some of the conditions
have already been settled between madame and myself
by letter, and that I hardly think madame would
like me to undertake this journey for nothing, though
I confess that I would have taken even a much longer
one for her sake, and to have the pleasure of seeing
her." My answer was: "There can be no doubt that
both of you will agree on all points&mdash;the emperor is
sure to consent, and madame herself is not likely to
propose anything that he cannot approve."</p>

<p>'The Duchess of Angoulême then said: "Madame
need not be jealous of the English, or imagine that
they can prevent my journey to Cambray, for in no
case would I miss the appointment.... The King of
England has sent full powers to treat in his name; he
and my son being allies, they are therefore unable to
discuss peace separately." ... She then asked if the
Cardinal of Liége were coming with madame, and if
he was a man who would aim at good? I answered:
"Yes, he is coming ... and is strongly attached to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
peace, and that Madame Margaret is incapable of
bringing in her suite people who do not desire
peace."</p>

<p>'The queen-mother then said that she intended
bringing her own chancellor ... but would not have
any princes or nobles in her suite because "her good
sister was bringing none, and in truth they were not
needed.... Of women," she said, "I only take with
me those of my own chamber, who are numerous
enough, for when Queen Claude died we kept them
all in our service, and many are also wanted for the
children.... You may tell my sister what my plans
are, and that I hope we may hear of each other daily.
Write also to her boldly that we must necessarily
contend and argue, but that I sincerely hope it
will be without anger or ill-will. I will tell her
things which she will be astonished to hear. She
thinks that the Pope is the emperor's friend, but I
can assure her that he is very far from being such,
for he is evidently trying to prevent the emperor's
journey to Italy before the treaty is concluded between
the parties, and in all other matters he will be found
very different from what you think. I do not mean
to imply thereby that he acts any better towards us;
such is, however, his condition, that he is of no good
to us, nor to you, nor to the Church itself."'<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Margaret made her entry into Cambray at three
o'clock on the afternoon of July 5th, 1529, accompanied
by a brilliant suite, and was welcomed by the
Cardinal of Liége and Monseigneur von Ysselstein,
who had preceded her. The Bishop of Cambray, the
Archbishop of Palermo, Count Hochstrate, and
many others accompanied the procession which slowly
wound its way through the town to the abbey of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
St. Aubert. Margaret was seated in a magnificent
litter, surrounded by a guard of twenty-four archers
on horseback, dressed in black suits edged with
velvet, and followed by a train of ladies mounted on
palfreys. At the abbey, where rooms had been
retained for her and her ladies, she alighted, and
awaited the arrival of the queen-regent. Two hours
later Louise of Savoy made her entry, accompanied by
her daughter, the Queen of Navarre, and the Countess
of Vendôme; and were immediately conducted
to Margaret's apartments, where they remained in
conversation with her for two hours. They then
retired to the Hôtel St. Paul, opposite the abbey,
but connected with it by a temporary covered way
which had been erected for the convenience of the
princesses, who could thus visit each other unseen.
Many years had passed since Margaret and Louise
had last met, for they had parted when Margaret set
forth on her wedding journey to marry Louise's
brother, Philibert of Savoy, and we can imagine that
the meeting between the two princesses must have
been one not unmixed with pain. For three weeks
they remained together, discussing the political situation
from all sides. At last, on the 24th of July, at
ten o'clock in the morning, peace was proclaimed, but
was again broken for various reasons, and in despair
the queen-mother threatened to leave. However, a
few days later all differences were satisfactorily settled,
and the treaty ratified on the last day of July. Margaret
again won general admiration for the able way
in which she conducted this difficult negotiation.
For this treaty, known as 'the Ladies' Peace,' was as
advantageous to Spain and the Netherlands as it was
humiliating to France. The terms were, in fact, a
mitigation of those of the Treaty of Madrid. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
agreed that the restitution of Burgundy was not for
the present to be insisted on, though the claim was
still maintained. But the king's sons were to be set
at liberty on the payment of 2,000,000 crowns, and the
marriage with the emperor's sister Eleanor was now
to be consummated. King Francis was to abandon
all his allies, and renounce his claims on the suzerainty
of Flanders and Artois, and abstain from sending
further help to the Duke of Gueldres or Robert de
la Marck. Charolais was to belong to Margaret for
her lifetime, and after her decease to the emperor,
but was to revert to the crown of France at his
death. The possessions of the Duke of Bourbon and
the Prince of Orange were to be ceded to Francis.
On the 5th of August the two princesses, attended
by the Papal Legate, Salviati, the ambassadors of
King Ferdinand and of the King of England, repaired
to the cathedral of Notre-Dame, where a solemn mass
was celebrated by Robert de Croy, Bishop of Cambray,
who preached a sermon on the benefits of peace.
The princesses and the English ambassador then knelt
before the high altar, and swore on the consecrated
Host and the Gospels to faithfully observe the peace
just concluded. After which the Dean of Cambray
advanced and in a loud voice proclaimed that peace
had been concluded between the Pope; the Emperor
Charles; Francis, King of France; Ferdinand, King
of Bohemia and Hungary; and Henry, King of England.
A separate peace between King Henry and
Madame Margaret was also proclaimed. The choir
chanted a <i>Te Deum</i>, and with a blare of trumpets
and clashing of cymbals the heralds announced to the
waiting crowds that 'Peace was made.'</p>

<p>The princesses were then conducted with much
pomp to their lodgings, and money was thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
broadcast amongst the people, whilst wine flowed
freely from fountains in the streets, and the whole
town gave itself up to merriment and rejoicing.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> A
beautiful carved wooden mantelpiece was also erected
in the council-chamber of the Hôtel of the Liberty
at Bruges to commemorate the capture of Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>
at Pavia, and the consequent treaty of peace between
the nations at Cambray. In the centre the statue
of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> stands in complete armour, surrounded
by twenty-seven shields of various kingdoms with
which he was allied. On his right are his paternal
grandparents, Maximilian <span class="smcap">I.</span> and Mary of Burgundy,
whilst on his left are his maternal ancestors, Ferdinand
and Isabella. This beautiful wooden trophy
was the work of Hermann Glosencamp, Andreas
Rasch, and Roger de Smet, after a design and under
the direction of Lancelot Blondel of Bruges and
Guyot de Beaugrant of Malines.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Clémont Marot and Jean Second also celebrated
'the Ladies' Peace' in verse, though their poems are
not of a very high order.</p>

<p>Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> awaited the issue of the Congress at the
abbey of Mont Saint Martin, and on hearing of the
conclusion of peace he set out on the 9th of August
to pay Margaret a visit at Cambray, and was present
at the festivities given by his mother at the Hôtel
Saint Paul. Margaret was anxious to conciliate
Francis, who was so soon to become the husband of
her niece Eleanor, and during the days they all spent
together at Cambray she succeeded in making great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
friends with him; and Massé, who was an eye-witness,
tells us that he left on the 20th for Paris
'quite delighted' with his visit.</p>

<p>A few weeks later we find him writing pathetic
letters to Margaret begging her to use her influence
with the emperor that his sons (who were kept in
Spain until their ransom was paid) might be better
treated, for he heard through his officer, Bodin, that
they were not as happy as he could wish. Margaret
was touched at this mark of the king's confidence,
and wrote a long letter to the emperor, begging him
to grant Francis's request, for 'Monseigneur, God
has given you the blessing of beautiful children, so
that you may better feel what a father's love is
worth, and can sympathise with the sorrow of the
said king; wherefore I beg of you to ... grant his
request, which is so just and reasonable....&mdash;Your
very humble aunt, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>.'</p>

<p>Shortly after, the long-delayed marriage between
Francis and Eleanor was consummated, the king
receiving his sons from the hands of his bride at
Bayonne, where he met them at the frontier. The
Marshal of Montmorency, who accompanied King
Francis, thus writes to Margaret from St. Jean de
Luz:&mdash;'Madame, I found the queen, whom I have
been to see the last few days since her arrival at the
frontier, so wise, beautiful, and honest a lady, who
conversed with me in as kind and pleasant a manner
as possible ... and we ought again to thank God
for having given us so good and virtuous a lady, of
whom it seems to me that I cannot express to you a
third part of the good and <i>honesteté</i> that I found
in her.'</p>

<p>Margaret also received constant news from England
concerning the progress of Queen Katharine's affairs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
In September 1529 Eustace Chapuys had written
to her from London telling her of an audience he
had had with King Henry, and later with Queen
Katharine. The conference with the king, he said,
would have been much longer and more to the purpose
had not his Majesty been in a hurry to go to
dinner in order to repair afterwards to the hunting-field
... as he is in the habit of doing at this
season of the year. As usual the conversation turned
chiefly on the queen's business, the king treating the
matter as one in which he was deeply concerned, and
which he had much at heart, and trying to appear
very learned in canon law. After dinner the king
gave permission for Chapuys to be conducted to the
queen's apartments in order that he might deliver
the emperor's letter to her. During the interview
her Majesty thanked him for all he had said in her
favour. On the 27th of September Chapuys wrote
another long despatch to Margaret giving lengthy
details of a further audience with the king, in which
the subject of the queen's divorce was once more
fully discussed.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the ratification of the Treaty of
Cambray Margaret and Louise entered into a negotiation
to consolidate the peace by a double marriage
between the emperor's children and those of King
Francis. From Bologna, where he had gone for
his double coronation, Charles sent Margaret the
necessary powers to treat in his name. In this document,
which is published amongst the State papers
of the Cardinal of Granvelle, he says:&mdash;'Because of
the very great, perfect, and entire confidence which
we have in our said lady and aunt, as in ourselves,
and in her experience and prudence, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
shown in the conducting, concluding, and perfecting
of the said peace made at Cambray, we have by these
presents constituted and made our aunt our general
and special proxy, etc....'</p>

<p>But Margaret did not live long enough to carry
out this interesting negotiation which would have
worthily crowned her political career. As it was,
the Peace of Cambray was her last great diplomatic
triumph, but she lived just long enough to see her
nephew Charles attain the zenith of his power, and
receive the double crowns of Lombardy and the
empire from the hands of the Pope, an honour for
which her father, Maximilian, had sighed in vain.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>THE MISSION ENDED</h3>

<p class="p2">Before Charles left Spain for Italy he had
concluded a separate treaty with the Pope
at Barcelona, the terms of which were more
advantageous to the Holy See than Clement <span class="smcap">VII.</span>
could have expected, considering the emperor's recent
successes. But Charles was anxious to atone for the
insults and outrages committed during the siege of
Rome, and if possible win the Pope as an ally, and
get him to oppose his aunt Katharine's divorce.
Amongst other articles he promised to restore all
property belonging to the ecclesiastical state, reestablish
the Medici in Florence, and marry his
natural daughter, Margaret, to the head of that
powerful house; allow the Pope to decide the fate
of the Sforza and the possession of the Milanese. In
return Clement was to grant the emperor the investiture
of Naples, absolve all who had been
implicated in the plundering of Rome, and allow
Charles and his brother to levy a fourth of the
ecclesiastical revenues throughout their dominions.</p>

<p>On October the 2nd, 1529, Margaret wrote a long
letter to the emperor from Brussels, in which she
plainly expressed her opinion of the Treaty of Barcelona
and its probable results:&mdash;'I do not pretend
to say,' she says, 'that the alliance with the Pope is
not a good and desirable thing; but your Majesty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
must bear in mind the character of his Holiness, his
inconstant humour and fickle disposition; and that
he must be greatly changed in temper and general
condition if he does not try now, as he did last time,
to expel you from Italy after he has got all he
wants from you.... Respecting Milan, my opinion
is that, considering the expense hitherto incurred,
your Majesty ought by all means to endeavour to
remain master of it by investing your son with it,
and treating with Massimiliano Sforza.... The
king, your brother, in the meanwhile, must be fully
provided with the means of defence, and money
procured for him to carry on a good enterprise against
the Turk....</p>

<p>'Your Majesty might attend to your own affairs in
Italy, and everything being settled there, depart for
Germany at the head of all your forces, leaving only
in Italy those strictly required for the defence of
Milan and Naples. This would naturally result in
great honour and reputation to your army, which
might be paid out of the money collected for the
intended expedition, and then you could not only
succour your brother, repulse the Turk, and perhaps
also follow him up to his own dominions, but also
increase our faith, which will be a far greater honour
and merit than losing your precious time in the
recovery of a few towns in Italy....'<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>At last the long-looked-for day came when Charles,
after a triumphal progress through Italy, entered
Bologna, on November the 5th, for his coronation, at
the head of twenty thousand veteran soldiers, and,
in token of his humility as an obedient son of the
Church, kneeled down to kiss the feet of that very
Pope whom he had but recently retained a prisoner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
On St. Peter's Day, February the 22nd, 1530, he
received the iron crown of Lombardy, and two days
later (St. Matthew's Day), the thirtieth anniversary
of his birth, he was crowned by Clement <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, in the
cathedral of San Petronio, with the imperial crown
of Charlemagne, amid all the gorgeous display and
ceremonial befitting so great an occasion.</p>

<p>In the grand procession at the emperor's coronation
at Bologna, Antonio da Leyva, the veteran hero
of Pavia, crippled with gout, was borne in a chair by
the emperor's command, next to Andrea Doria, before
the archbishops and bishops, and his horse led
by two noblemen. Brantôme gives the following
account of the procession:&mdash;'Four thousand Spanish
soldiers, veterans who had served in the late wars,
marched at the head of it under the command of
Antonio da Leyva, richly dressed, borne in a sort of
chair covered with crimson velvet. Afterwards came
eighteen pieces of heavy artillery, with their ammunition
waggons and all their accompaniments, followed
by a thousand men-at-arms of the old equipment of
Burgundy, all well mounted and cased in armour,
over which hung their beautiful and rich mantles,
with lances at the thigh. Then came the pages of
the emperor, about four-and-twenty in number,
superbly clothed in yellow, grey, and violet velvet,
mounted on beautiful horses. These were followed
by the Grand Ecuyer in steel armour, bearing in his
right hand his imperial Majesty's sword of state.
After him rode the emperor, mounted on the most
beautiful Spanish genet, a dark bay, clad in the
richest armour, inlaid with gold, over which was a
mantle of cloth of gold, leaving one side and the right
arm exposed; on his head he wore a bonnet of black
velvet without ornament or plume. The cardinals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
came next, with their large hats on. They were
followed by some of the principal nobles of the Court
heading a troop of four or five hundred gentlemen.
To these again succeeded fifteen hundred light horse
and men-at-arms all accoutred with helmets. Three
thousand men on foot, Spaniards, Italians and
Landsknechts, formed the rear-guard.'</p>

<p>This, adds Brantôme, was a procession 'fit for a
great emperor, enough to make the earth tremble, as
well as the Heaven itself, when the artillery began to
roar with the devil of a noise, which Don Antonio
knew well how to play off, with discharges of the
arquebusades re-echoing from the whole line of
soldiers.'</p>

<p>He afterwards mentions the ceremonial observed
between the Pope and emperor when the latter performed
his act of submission or homage. 'When
they approached each other, the emperor, sinking on
his knees, kissed the feet of the Pope, and rising,
kissed his hand. His Holiness on his part, whilst
some of the attendants behind raised the mitre from
his head, kissed the emperor's cheek. This done, the
emperor was again on his knees, when the Pope,
making a gracious gesture, begged him to rise. One
of the attendants then drawing a piece of gold from
a pocket in the imperial mantle, placed it in his
Majesty's hand, of which the emperor made an offering
to the Pope as a representative of his power, and
thus addressed him: 'Holy Father, thanks be to
God above who has conceded to me so great a favour
that I should arrive in safety here to kiss the feet of
your Holiness, and be received with greater kindness
than I can ever merit, and thus I place myself under
your safeguard.'<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
But for Clement <span class="smcap">VII.</span> this ceremony can have been
no pleasant task. 'The Pope,' wrote the Bishop of
Tarbes, 'tried to show the emperor the best cheer
possible; but I think he never in his life performed
a ceremony which touched him so near the heart, nor
of which less good is likely to come to him. For
several times, when he thought no one saw him, he
heaved such sighs that, heavy as his cope was, he
made it shake in good earnest.'<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> This memorable
day in the annals of the House of Austria marked
the summit of Margaret's ambitious hopes for the
nephew she had mothered with such unceasing care.
She had lived to see the children over whose welfare
she had so tenderly watched grow up to fill some of
the most brilliant positions in Europe. Charles was
now a thrice-crowned king and emperor; Ferdinand,
King of Hungary and Bohemia (and was shortly to
be elected King of the Romans); whilst Eleanor had
become first Queen of Portugal and then Queen of
France; the short-lived Isabel, Queen of Denmark;
Mary, Queen of Hungary; and Katharine, who succeeded
her sister, Queen of Portugal.</p>

<p>Although only in her fiftieth year, Margaret began
to look forward to the time when she could hand over
the government of the Netherlands to her nephew
Charles and spend the rest of her days in quiet seclusion.
For her life had been a very strenuous one,
full of great responsibility and unceasing work, and
now that she felt her mission accomplished, she longed
for her nephew's advent and her own retirement
from political life. Chiefly owing to her intervention,
that peace which it had been her lifelong endeavour
to promote, now reigned throughout Europe,
and under her wise rule the Netherlands had reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
the zenith of their prosperity. Art, industry, and
commerce flourished in the Low Countries as they
had never flourished before. Encouraged by Margaret,
a brilliant group of artists, poets, and literary men
settled at her Court at Malines. Merchants from
England, Spain, France, and Italy attended the great
fairs, and traded in arms, embroideries, tapestries,
velvets, satins, cloth, and leather goods. Malines
became noted for its various industries, and Brussels,
Ypres, Liége, Ghent, Lille, and Tournay all rose
rapidly into commercial centres. Architecture made
enormous strides, and music, painting, and literature
received a new birth.</p>

<span class="smcap1">NOW THE PALACE DE JUSTICE</span><br />
<a href="images/illus336_b.jpg">View larger image</a></p>

<p>In her palace at Malines Margaret collected all
that was rare and beautiful, and her rooms were
veritable museums, as the inventory written under
her direction shows. Priceless tapestries hung on
the walls, some of which she had brought from Spain,
whilst others were presented to her on various occasions.
Many rich and valuable objects are mentioned
in her catalogue: Statuettes, gold and silver caskets
and mirrors, crystal, chalcedony and jasper goblets
and vases, carved ivories, amber, corals, and curiously
wrought chessmen, beautiful fans, medallions, clocks
of rare workmanship which struck the hours and half-hours,
magnificent plate, sometimes inlaid with precious
stones, glass and pottery, suits of armour, ivory
hunting horns, and various relics of the chase. Her
private library contained many rare and valuable books,
chiefly bound in velvet (crimson, green, black, and
blue), with gold and silver clasps, besides illuminated
manuscripts, several bearing her devices in the borders
and strewn with painted 'marguerites.' The 'Bibliothèque
Royale' at Brussels possesses several manuscripts
from Margaret's collection. Amongst others,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
her 'Book of Hours'; four of her albums; 'La Bible
Historiale,' with portraits of her and Philip kneeling
at their 'prie-dieu'; Her 'Album Musical,' and her
book of 'Basses Danses' on black paper, with gold
notes and letters, containing a set of dances fashionable
in her day&mdash;'La Marguerite,' 'l'Espérance de Bourbon,'
'M'amour-m'amie,' 'Filles à marier,' 'Le joyeux
de Bruxelles,' etc. A portrait of Margaret in water-colours
is also in the library, and is probably by
Horembout. When Margaret undertook the regency
of the Netherlands in 1507, her father, Maximilian,
gave her as a New Year's gift a beautifully illuminated
<i>Livre de Chants</i>, in the frontispiece of which the
United States are represented swearing fealty to her
as regent. Maximilian is seated in the centre on
a throne; in front of him sits his grandson Charles,
with Margaret opposite; and the three young arch-duchesses,
Eleanor, Mary, and Isabel, are grouped
seated on the ground, whilst the representatives of
the United States stand round, and with uplifted
hands swear to uphold the regent's rule. This
interesting book was one of Margaret's most prized
possessions, and is now amongst the archives of
Malines.</p>

<p>From the titles of the books in her library we learn
how large and varied was her taste in reading: Froissart,
the <i>Fables</i> of Æsop and of Ovid, several editions
of Aristotle, Livy, the <i>Letters of Seneca</i>, and the
<i>Commentaries of Julius Caesar</i>, Saint Augustine's
<i>City of God</i>, of which she had four copies, and Boethius
<i>On Consolation</i>. Besides these, there were <i>The Golden
Legend</i>, <i>The Round Table</i>, <i>Lancelot of the Lake</i>, <i>Merlin</i>,
<i>The Story of Jason and the Golden Fleece</i>, etc.
Also several books on chess, on the interpretation of
dreams, on the nature of birds, and on manners and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
customs, such as the <i>Miroir du Monde</i> and the <i>Miroir
des Dames</i>; various works of Boccaccio, <i>Le Livre du
Trésor</i>, and Phebus on hunting, etc. Besides many
missals, breviaries, lives and legends of the Saints,
'Books of Hours,' and other religious works.</p>

<p>Jean Lemaire says: 'Madame Margaret not only
read wise books, but she also took the pen in hand
to write' ... and fortunately many of her poems have
been preserved. Through nearly all there runs a
strain of sadness, of loneliness, and disappointed hope,
for Margaret's life was very solitary in spite of her
great position and many duties; every one came to
her for help and sympathy, but there was no one on
whom she could lean. Her verses are simple, graceful,
and to the point, and may well bear comparison
with those of her contemporaries. The following charming
rondeau in her handwriting is a good example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'C'est pour jamès qu'un regret me demeure;</p>
<p>Que sans sesser nuit et jour à tout eure</p>
<p>Tant me tourmant que bien voudroi mourir;</p>
<p>Car ma vie n'est fors seulement languir,</p>
<p>Et s'y faudra à la fin que j'en meure.</p>
<p>De l'infortune estais bien seure</p>
<p>Quan le regret maudit où je demeure</p>
<p>Me coury sus pour me faire mourir,</p>
<p>Car ma vie n'est fors</p>
<p>Seulement languir:</p>
<p>Sy faudra que j'en meure.'<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>Her poem, 'La complainte de dame Marguerite
d'Autriche, fille de Maximilien, Roy des Romans,' is
an interesting résumé of her life and misfortunes,
full of feeling charmingly expressed, but is too long
to quote here.</p>

<p>In the following she gives advice to her maids of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
honour, and warns them not to trust to lovers' deceitful
promises:&mdash;</p>

<p>These few fragments give an idea of Margaret's
style, which was simple, clear, and well expressed,
but throughout her rondeaux, songs, and ballads,
there is an echo of sadness and disappointment.
Many of her words and expressions are now out of
date, but the charm of her personality still lingers
in her poems with a mournful pathos none the less
touching though written in a French of long ago:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>But amongst all the treasures she had gathered
together, her picture-gallery at Malines was not the
least interesting part of her wonderful collection.
More than a hundred portraits and paintings are
mentioned in her catalogue, chiefly by famous artists
of the day. Amongst others there are several by
Bernard van Orley (her Court painter), John Memling,
Michel von Coxie, John van Eyck, Roger van der
Weyden, Mabuse, Bouts, Jacob de Barbari, Jerome
Bosch, Gerard Horembout, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
The John Van Eyck of John Arnolfini and his
wife Joan Cenani of Lucca (who settled at Bruges in
1420), now in the National Gallery, London, was one
of the gems of Margaret's collection, and is thus
mentioned in her catalogues of 1516 and 1524:&mdash;</p>

<div class="font90">
<p>'Ung grant tableau qu'on appelle Hernoul-le-Fin avec sa femme

<p>Its history is peculiarly interesting. Before 1490
it belonged to Don Diego de Guevara, one of
Maximilian's Councillors, who added shutters to it,
on the outer side of which were painted his arms
and motto. Don Diego presented the picture to
Margaret. After her death it came into the possession
of a barber-surgeon of Bruges from whom Mary,
Queen of Hungary, bought it in exchange for a place
worth a hundred florins a year. The picture is
mentioned in an inventory of the queen's effects in
1556. Later it was taken to Spain, and in 1789 was
in Charles <span class="smcap">III.</span>'s collection at Madrid, but afterwards
fell into the hands of one of the French generals. In
1815 Major-General Hay, who had been wounded at
Waterloo, found it in the house to which he was removed
in Brussels, and after his recovery purchased
it and brought it to England, where in 1842 it was
bought by the National Gallery for £730.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we cannot thus trace the history of
all Margaret's collection. Her library at Malines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
was hung with family portraits, from Charlemagne
on through many Dukes of Burgundy&mdash;her grandfather,
the Emperor Frederick; her parents, Maximilian
and Mary of Burgundy; her brother Philip; her
husband Philibert, Duke of Savoy; her nephews and
nieces, at different ages, were all portrayed; and
there was also a portrait of herself as a girl. Her
pictures are all fully entered in her catalogue, with
such charming descriptions as:&mdash;'Une petite Nostre-Dame
disant ses heures, faicte de la main de Michel
(Coxie) que Madame appelle sa mignonne et le petit
dieu dort,' or 'Ung petit tableau ront de Nostre-Dame
que Madame fait mettre au chevet de son lit,'
or 'Ung petit paradis ou sont touxs les apôtres,' etc.</p>

<p>Margaret not only collected pictures, but she drew
and painted skilfully herself, a most unusual accomplishment
for a princess at that time, and amongst
her possessions was a paint-box and brushes; she also
is said to have drawn part of the plans for a church
at Bruges.</p>

<p>During her regency architecture made great progress,
and many beautiful buildings were designed
and executed. The belfry at Bruges, the cloisters
of the Convent of the Annunciation near the same
town, and the Tower of St. Rombault at Malines,
the Hôtel de Ville at Ghent, besides several churches
which were restored and embellished, such as the
churches of St. Peter and St. Stephen at Lille, the
spire of Antwerp Cathedral and Ste. Gudule at
Brussels. But the greatest monument to Margaret's
memory and taste in architecture is the church
of Brou, near the town of Bourg en Bresse, of
which a full description is given elsewhere, and for
the construction of which Mercurin de Gattinare
advised 'sa très redoubtée dame de vendre jusqu'à sa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
dernière chemise.' In this beautiful church the spirit
of Margaret seems to pervade every part, bringing
into perfect harmony the work of the various
Flemish, French, German, and Italian artists she
employed.</p>

<p>Margaret also did much to encourage a taste for
music, and the names of several of her musicians and
composers have been preserved. Maître Agricola
wrote accompaniments to her songs, and Bruneel,
Josquin des Prés, Compère, Henry Isaac, and Pierre
de la Rue are all mentioned as attached to her
Court. Flemish singers were sought for far and
wide, especially in Italy and France, and many of the
Pope's choir were recruited from the Netherlands.</p>

<p>But if Margaret did much for art, she did no less
for literature. Grouped around her stand forth the
names of such men as Jean Molinet, Jean Lemaire
de Beiges, Adrian of Utrecht, Cornelius Agrippa,
Erasmus, Massé, Nicolas Everard, Renacle de
Florennes, Louis Vivés, and many others whom she
welcomed to her Court, lodged in her palace, and
counted amongst her friends. It is no wonder that
they sang her praises in prose and in verse, extolling
her beauty, her golden hair, fresh complexion, and
soft brown eyes, exclaiming how lovely she looked
when attending the dances given on festive occasions,
or dressed in satin with long hanging sleeves lined
with ermine, and followed by her greyhound, parrot,
and marmoset, she wandered amongst her roses in
her sweet-scented garden at Malines.</p>

<p>Molinet, her librarian, comes first among the poets
who celebrated her charms. Besides his chronicles,
he wrote 'La Récollection des Merveilleuses,' and
several epigrams. The following verses on Margaret's
return are a curious <i>tour de force</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Par vous nous vint grâce, miséricorde,</p>

<p>Et recorder, accord fut par cordée,</p>
<p>La bonne harpe est tantôt accordée.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>Jean Lemaire de Belges was born about 1473;
after the death of Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> he attached himself to
Margaret's Court and became her historian. He
published a curious work called <i>Les illustrations de
Gaule et singularitez de Troye, avec la Couronne
Margaritique et plusieurs autres &oelig;uvres</i>. In the
<i>Couronne Margaritique</i>, Margaret figures as the
heroine. Jean Lemaire also published the <i>Triomphe
de l'Amant vert</i>, which is the history of a green
parrot given by Sigismond, Archduke of Austria, to
Margaret's mother, Mary of Burgundy, after whose
death it passed into Margaret's possession. She was
naturally very fond of the bird, and when it died
composed the following epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Souz ce tumbel, qui est un dur conclave,</p>
<p>Git l'amant verd, et le très noble esclave,</p>
<p>Dont le noble c&oelig;ur de vraye amour, pure, yvre,</p>
<p>Ne peut souffrir perdre sa dame et vivre.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>The parrot died whilst Margaret was on a visit to
her father in Germany. In Lemaire's poem 'L'amant
vert' laments his beloved mistress's absence, he stops
talking, and contemplates 'putting an end to his
short days.'</p>

<p>Then comes the epitaph quoted above. L'amant
vert finally addresses his mistress from the tomb, and
describes his descent into Hades, where he meets
Mercury and converses with him in the Elysian
fields.</p>

<p>Rénacle de Florennes sang Margaret's praises in
Latin verse, and it was largely due to her influence
that the emperor appointed him his private secretary.
The four Everards and Jean Second all added their
tribute in her honour; whilst Adrian of Utrecht, the
future Pope, and the learned Cornelius Agrippa
remained through life her firm and devoted friends.</p>

<p>During the sixteenth century the beautiful industry
of tapestry-making reached almost its highest point
of perfection. After the fall of Arras in 1477 the
workmen from that town settled in Bruges, Brussels,
and Tournay. Amongst the great tapestry-workers
were Stephen of Brumberghe, John of Roubrouck,
Perquin d'Ervine, Peter van Oppenem, John van
den Brugghe, etc., but the prince of tapestry-makers
was Peter van Aelst, who for more than thirty years
turned out tapestries innumerable from his workshops,
the most celebrated being 'The Acts of the Apostles.'
Although during the Middle Ages the designs chiefly
represented religious subjects from the Old and New
Testaments, in the sixteenth century, with the influence
of the Renaissance, there crept in a taste for
mythological and historical scenes such as those in
the Hôtel de Ville at Brussels, or the Legend of
Notre Dame du Sablon, which latter contains contemporary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
portraits of Margaret and her nephews
and nieces;<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> or the Legend of Trajan, the Story of
Herkenbald, and the History of Julius Caesar attributed
to the designs of Roger van der Weyden.
John de Maubeuge, or Mabuse, and Bernard van
Orley also exercised a wide influence over the industry,
and their beautiful compositions were much sought
after. With Van Orley a secular feeling prevailed
even in his religious subjects. His saints and angels,
Virgins and Apostles, appear almost pagan in design.
It is easy to follow the different phases of this
beautiful industry in such pieces as 'The Acts of the
Apostles' in the Vatican, 'Saint Gregory's Mass' at
Nuremberg, 'The Story of Psyche' at Fontainebleau,
'The Triumphs of Bacchus,' the 'Rape of the
Sabines,' etc.</p>

<p>After his coronation at Bologna the emperor continued
his progress through Trent, Bötzen, Innsbruck,
to Augsburg, where he attended the Diet
which opened on June the 20th, 1530. There he
met Melanchthon and listened to his famous confession,
and the long arguments which followed on
religious questions. Lutheranism was rapidly spreading
in Germany, but the emperor was powerless to
prevent it. Charles remained at Augsburg until
November 23rd, and then continued his journey towards
the Netherlands, where Margaret was anxiously
awaiting him; but she and her beloved nephew were
destined never to meet again on earth, for when he
reached Cologne he received the news of her death.</p>

<p>For some time past Margaret seems to have
cherished the hope of retiring to the Convent of the
Annunciation which she had founded outside the
'Porte des Anes' at Bruges, and spending the rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
of her days there in quiet seclusion. From Malines
she wrote to the Mother Superior:&mdash;'Ma Mère, ma
mie,&mdash;I have ordered the bearer of this, whom you
know well, to give you news of me, and tell you of
my good resolution for some days past, and also
inquire how you are, which I hope is as well as you
could wish for me. My hope is in the good God and
his glorious Mother, who will help and keep you for
better things. I have given him (the bearer) a
memorandum for you, and the Pater, your good
father, which is from my own hand; from this you
will learn my intention. I desire that it shall not get
talked about ('n'en soit faict grant bruit'), and for
good reason, and with this I will end, begging you to
recommend me to our good father's prayers, and also to
all my good daughters, praying the Creator and His
blessed Mother to give His grace to you and also to
me.&mdash;Your good daughter, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>.'</p>

<p>Then follows the memorandum to Estienne, her
<i>valet de chambre</i>, concerning what he is to say to
the Pater and the Mère Ancille:<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> 'First, that I wish
above all to put my religious (community) in such a
state that they will never be in great poverty, but
will be able to live without begging; and I wish to
know ... if more money is needed, and if so, how
much, that they may not be stinted; for with God's
help I will see to all; and every other thing that they
desire, they must let me know, for I intend to make
there a good end, with the help of God and our good
Mistress, His glorious Mother.</p>

<p>'Amongst other things say to the Mère Ancille, my
good mother, that I beg her to make all my good
daughters pray for the purpose which I have always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
told her; for the time approaches, since the emperor
is coming, to whom, with God's help, I will render a
good account of the charge and government which
he has pleased to give me; and this done, I shall
give myself up to the will of God and of our good
Mistress, begging you, my good Mother, "ma mie,"
that I may not be forgotten by yours, and always
remain your good daughter, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>.'</p>

<p>Concerning the death of the Regent of the
Netherlands very little is authentically known, but
from a MSS. in the archives at Ain, written by an
Augustine monk, the following account is found:&mdash;'Early
on the morning of the 15th of November,
before rising, Margaret asked one of her ladies,
Magdalen of Rochester, for a glass of water. The
maid of honour brought her the drink in a crystal
goblet, but in taking it back Magdalen unluckily let
it fall near the bed, where it broke in several pieces.
She carefully picked up all the fragments she could
see, but one piece lay hidden in Margaret's high-heeled
embroidered slipper. When the princess got
up a few hours later, she put her bare feet into the
slippers, and tried to walk towards the fire, but
immediately felt a sharp pain in the sole of her left
foot. On examination it was found that a piece of
broken glass was in the foot; this was at once
extracted, but the wound remained, and bled very
little. Margaret, who was always plucky, soon
thought no more of the accident, and neglected the
wound. A few days later, however, her leg became
greatly inflamed, and she suffered much pain. At
last, on the 22nd, doctors were called in, and a consultation
was held. They found that gangrene had
already set in, and decided that the only way to save
her life was to amputate the foot. The next day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
the 23rd, they commissioned M. de Montécute, her
almoner and confessor, to break the news to her, and
prepare her for the terrible operation. She was
naturally much surprised and upset, but with great
fortitude consented to undergo the dreadful ordeal.
For four days she shut herself up, and would see no
one, spending the time in prayer and confession; on
the morning of the 27th she received the Sacrament,
and on the 28th and 29th she arranged her earthly
affairs, and added a codicil to the will she had made
in 1508. This codicil did not, however, fundamentally
alter her former testament. She left Charles her
sole heir, with the exception of a few bequests, such
as 'one of her best rings' to his brother Ferdinand,
and legacies to her old officers and servants. 'And
in order not to abolish the name of the House of
Burgundy ... my said lady begs and implores the
Lord Emperor to be pleased to keep in his own hands
the said county of Burgundy, and its dependencies,
as long as he lives, and after his death to leave it
to the one of his children or other heirs who may
succeed to these countries (the Netherlands), without
dividing or separating it.'</p>

<p>'And as a last request of my said lady made to the
said Lord Emperor, she begs him for the universal
good of Christianity and the safety of his State, to
keep, guard, and observe peace and friendship with
the Kings of France and England, their realms,
countries, and subjects; as she hopes to say to him
with her own mouth if it pleases God to spare her
life until she can see him.'</p>

<p>On the next day, the 30th, the doctors decided to
operate, but before submitting herself to their hands
Margaret dictated a last touching letter to Charles,
in which she bade him an eternal farewell:&mdash;'Monseigneur,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
the hour has come when I can no longer
write to you with my own hand, for I feel so ill, that
I doubt not that my life will be short. With my
conscience at rest and peace, and resolved to receive
all that it may please God to send me, without any
regret whatever, excepting the privation of your
presence, and not being able to see and speak to you
once more before my death, which is partly supplied
by this my letter, though I fear that it will be the
last that you will receive from me. I have made you
my universal and sole heir, recommending you to
fulfil the charges in my will. I leave you your
countries over here, which, during your absence, I
have not only kept as you left them to me at your
departure, but have greatly increased them, and
restore to you the government of the same, of which
I believe to have loyally acquitted myself, in such a
way as I hope for divine reward, satisfaction from
you, monseigneur, and the goodwill of your subjects;
particularly recommending to you peace,
especially with the Kings of France and England.
And to end, monseigneur, I beg of you for the love
you have been pleased to bear this poor body, that
you will remember the salvation of the soul, and the
recommendation of my poor vassals and servants.
Bidding you the last adieu, to whom I pray, monseigneur,
to give you prosperity and a long life.
From Malines, the last day of November 1530.&mdash;Your
very humble aunt, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>.'</p>

<p>And so having arranged all her earthly affairs
Margaret took a tender farewell of her attendants
and friends, and placed herself in the physicians'
hands, who, hoping to spare her the pain and shock
of an operation, gave her a dose of opium, which was
so strong that she fell asleep never to wake again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
She passed away during the night of the 30th of
November 1530 between midnight and one o'clock,
in the fiftieth year of her age, and the twenty-third
year of her regency.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Palermo, Jean de Carondelet, and
Antoine de Lalaing, Count of Hochstrate, at once
sent to Cologne to inform the emperor of the sad
news. In their letter they said that the inflammation
(gangrene) had spread from the princess's leg to her
body (probably from the long delay), and therefore an
operation would have been useless. No one, however,
seems to have been blamed, and Philip Savoien,
her surgeon, was given thirty philippus 'for having
treated madame as well as he could, and for having
embalmed her body.' As the archbishop and the
Count of Hochstrate wrote to the emperor:
'Madame has indeed shown in her end the virtue
that was in her, for she died as good a Christian as
it seems to us possible to be. She is a great loss,
Sire, to your Majesty, and to all your countries over
here.'</p>

<p>Charles was greatly distressed when he learned
that his beloved aunt had passed away, and ordered
magnificent obsequies to be performed in the
cathedral of Cologne, which he attended with his
whole Court. The funeral sermon, delivered in
Latin by Jean Fabri, was listened to with rapt
attention by the large congregation which filled the
building.</p>

<p>Margaret was deeply mourned by all who knew
her, and especially by the people over whom she had
ruled so well.</p>

<p>In her will she directed that her heart should be
given to the Convent of the 'Annonciades' at
Bruges, her intestines to the church of St. Peter and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
St. Paul at Malines, and her body to the Monastery
of St. Nicolas de Tolentin at Bourg en Bresse, where
she wished to be buried beside her husband, Philibert
of Savoy, in the church of Brou.</p>

<p>Her funeral services began in the church of St.
Peter and St. Paul at Malines by three solemn
masses, and were continued in the cathedral church
of St. Rombault, which was hung with 120 yards of
black cloth for the occasion. The Archbishop of
Palermo conducted the service, which was attended
by the Grand Council and Magistrates, and all the
guilds of the city. Here Cornelius Agrippa preached
her funeral oration, dwelling at much length on her
many virtues and great talents. 'We have lost,' he
said, 'the anchor on which our hopes rested. We
are weighed down with this great affliction, for no
greater loss could have befallen us and our country.
What consolation can we find in the death of the
very saintly Princess Margaret? We all weep, we
all lament her! All the provinces, all the cities, all
the towns, all the villages, all the hamlets are plunged
in grief, sorrow, and mourning.'</p>

<p>On the 22nd of January 1531, a funeral procession,
headed by the young Crown Prince of Denmark, as
chief mourner, escorted Margaret's body and heart to
Bruges. Whilst awaiting translation to its final
resting-place at Brou, her body was laid in a vault
beneath the high altar in the Convent of the
'Annonciades'; her heart, enclosed in an urn, was
placed in the tomb of her mother, Mary of Burgundy,
in the church of Notre-Dame, but on the 6th of
February following, it was given to the Mère Ancille
by the emperor's command to replace her body, which,
on April the 21st, 1532, was sent to Brou. This
long delay in carrying Margaret to her final resting-place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
was due to the fact that at the time of her
death the church of Brou was not finished, and it
was two years before the tombs were completed. But
at last in June 1532 Margaret was laid to rest beside
Philibert and his mother in the beautiful church
which her love and piety had called into being, but
whose glories she had not lived to see completed.
The funeral ceremonies lasted three days, the 10th,
11th, and 12th of June. Accompanied by the chief
men of the town, the Syndic of Bourg went out to
meet the funeral <i>cortège</i>, which was escorted by the
Marshal of Burgundy, the Count of Hochstrate, the
Archdeacon of Fauverny, and Claud de Boisset, who
was afterwards Bishop of Arras. At the service the
sermon was preached by Brother Anthony of Saix,
Commander of the Abbey of St. Anthony of Bourg,
in French as well as in Latin, so that all might
understand. Amongst her many talents he mentioned
'her subtle excellence in painting,' in which
pastime he asserted she frequently indulged.</p>

<p>The leaden urn which contained her intestines was
placed in a vault in front of the high altar in the
church of St. Peter and St. Paul at Malines, but in
1778 the urn was found to be much damaged, and
was enclosed in an oaken chest, and reburied under
one of the stone slabs in the choir, between the first
step of the high altar and the wall, where a small X
in the pavement marks the spot.</p>

<p>By her will Margaret dowered fifty maidens of Bresse
with fifty pounds apiece, and amongst other legacies
bequeathed her wine-glass incrusted with silver, a
silver spoon and silver medal to the 'Annonciades' at
Bruges; besides a gilded and illuminated copy of the
Gospel of St. John, and her rosary, which contained
ten agates, on the largest of which were engraved the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
virtues of the Holy Virgin Mary. This relic had
been worn by Jeanne de Valois, the unhappy wife of
Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> of France, foundress of the Order of the
Annunciation. The other stones were interspersed
with small beads of gold, a gold heart hanging from
the end of the rosary. This gift was accompanied by
a portrait of Margaret painted on wood by Bernard
van Orley, and two touching letters addressed to the
Mère Ancille. The Church of the 'Annonciades'
was demolished in 1578, when the nuns retired to
a house called 'Fluweelhof' at Bruges, carrying Margaret's
remains with them.</p>

<p>In 1531 the emperor caused an alabaster monument,
decorated with gold statuettes, to be erected to
Margaret's memory in the church outside the Porte
des Anes. But in 1578 it was horribly mutilated by
the rebels, and what was left of it was transferred in
1714 to the church of the new Convent at Fluweelhof.
A pavement of black and white marble was added,
and a figure representing the Annunciation of the
Virgin, before whom Margaret was depicted kneeling
at her prie-dieu, holding her 'Book of Hours' in her
hands, with her patron saint, Margaret, behind her,
and her maids of honour by her side, bearing the
arms of the empire, Burgundy, Bourbon, and Castile.
The débris of the former monument was used to make
these figures. In the centre of the niche containing
the monument was placed a painted heart in a mirror
with this inscription in Flemish:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Here lies the noble heart of the very excellent
Archduchess of Austria, Madame Margaret, daughter
of the invincible Emperor Maximilian and of the
Lady Mary of Burgundy, his wife, foundress of this
Convent of the Annunciation at Bruges, niece of
Jeanne, Queen of France, and foundress of the Order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
of the Annunciation, widow of the Prince of Spain,
etc., aunt of his Imperial Majesty Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>, who
gave this heart in the year 1531, the 6th of Feb., in
eternal remembrance.'</p>

<p>In the same niche behind the figure of St. Margaret
is the inscription which the emperor also caused to be
erected at Malines:&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>THE CHURCH OF BROU</h3>

<p class="p2">The church of Brou, near the town of Bourg
en Bresse, was built by Margaret of Austria
in the beginning of the sixteenth century,
as a monument to her husband, Philibert of Savoy,
and in fulfilment of a vow made by Duke Philibert's
mother, Margaret of Bourbon, in 1480.</p>

<p>The first stone was laid by Margaret in 1506, and
the building finished in 1530; but the work did not
really begin until 1513, and the interior decoration
was not completed before 1532.</p>

<p>Whilst in Flanders Margaret carefully watched
over and superintended the progress of the work,
but she did not live to see it finished, and after
her death Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> took little interest in the completion
of the building.</p>

<p>The church was consecrated on the 22nd of March
1532 by Bishop Jean Joly de Fleury and dedicated
to Saint Nicolas de Tolentin.</p>

<p>The church of Brou is of the latest, and not the
best, period of Gothic architecture, but the genius of
Margaret is visible in all its details, harmonising the
work, whether Gothic or Renaissance, and creating
a building of extraordinary beauty. French, Italian,
and German artists helped in building this princely
monument, which remains a fitting memorial to one
of the most cultivated women of her time.</p>

<p>The plan of the church is very simple. A Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
cross with five naves; the transept and sanctuary
separated by a rood screen. The length is about 225
feet, and its greatest width, in the transept, 120 feet.
Outside, the central building is divided into three
distinct stories. The façade, with its great door
decorated with devices and emblems. An <i>Ecce Homo</i>
in the centre, on either side Philibert and Margaret
kneeling between two angels, and accompanied by
their patron saints. A statue of Saint Nicholas de
Tolentin guarding the entrance.</p>

<p>On the second story are three pointed windows
between two galleries. Above the upper gallery is a
triangular gable with a rose window in the centre,
surrounded by three triangular windows, a symbol of
the Trinity. Inside, the carved woodwork of the
choir stalls is remarkable for its beauty of detail,
variety of design, and delicacy of carving. The stalls
are the work of Bressian artists, foremost amongst
whom was Pierre Terrason of Bourg. They were
finished and put up in 1532. There are seventy-four
stalls on each side, in two rows&mdash;twenty-one above
and sixteen below. The design on each stall is
different.</p>

<p>But the tombs in the choir are the most interesting
features of the church of Brou.</p>

<p>Jean Perréal (called Jean de Paris) had been commissioned
by Margaret to prepare the plans, and after
years of work he presented her with a design which
she considered perfect, and gave orders to have it
carried out. But soon after Perréal was dismissed,
and Van Boghen presided over the work. There is
little doubt that he made use of the French architect's
designs, which Margaret possessed,<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> but he evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
made important modifications, as the work bears
distinct traces of Flemish influence. The best Belgian,
French, Italian, and Swiss workmen were employed
on these monuments. The principal work was given
to a Swiss, Conrad Meyt, who undertook to make
the five large statues. The three monuments are
placed in the positions Margaret desired in her will of
1508&mdash;Duke Philibert in the centre, his mother on
the right, and her tomb on the left.</p>

<p>Margaret of Bourbon's monument is built into the
thickness of the wall. The princess's statue rests on
a slab of black marble, her head on an embroidered
cushion, her feet on a greyhound. Four white marble
children support shields with her initials and the arms
of Bourbon. On the pillars on either side are five
exquisite statuettes. Saint Agnes and Saint Margaret
stand near her feet, between them a symbolical female
figure, whilst near her head are Saint Andrew with
his cross, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria dressed
as a maid of honour of Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>'s Court. The sarcophagus
is decorated with nine niches containing five
cherubs and four 'pleureuses,' or weeping women,
whose faces are almost hidden by their drooping
hoods, sprays of marguerites being scattered everywhere
in great profusion about the moulding of the
pillars.</p>

<p>In the centre of the choir, facing the high altar, is
the tomb of Philibert the Handsome, Duke of Savoy.
It is divided into two sections. Underneath is the
'gisant,' or naked body, a little larger than life.
Twelve pillars, ornamented with niches containing
statues of saints in the dress of the period, surround
the dead prince and support a slab of black
marble on which the figure of Philibert rests in armour,
with his coronet on his head, an embroidered surcoat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
covers his cuirass, the collar of the Annunciation
(composed alternately of fifteen enamelled roses and
the letters F.E.R.T.) round his neck, the mantle of
the Order wrapt round him, his feet resting on a
lion. His face is turned towards his wife on the
left, his praying hands towards his mother on the
right.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Margaret of Austria's tomb under the arcade which
separates the choir from the chapel of the Virgin is
much larger than the other two. The princess is
represented twice; underneath lies her dead body in
the habit of the Annunciation, her beautiful hair
covering her like a mantle, and her feet bare, showing
the wound on the sole of the left foot which caused
her death. Above she lies as though on a state-bed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
wearing her coronet and embroidered robes, her arms
folded on her breast. Four beautiful cherubs bear
her armorial ensigns, two at her head and two at her
feet (the work of Thomas Meyt, the brother of Conrad).
Four columns richly moulded spring from the base of
the tomb and support the heavy canopy overhead,
around which runs her motto: 'Fortune. Infortune.
Fort. Une'; whilst everywhere in the richest profusion
are carved her emblems, marguerites twining
round a palm branch, and the Briquet of Burgundy
in the form of a B interlaced with a St. Andrew's
cross resting on three stones.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> And in the niches of
the pillars figures of Saints and Virgins, marvels of
beauty, stand grouped around, as if guarding her last
sleep.</p>

<p>This magnificent monument was the work of many
skilled sculptors, amongst others Jean de Louhans,
Jean Rodin, Amé de Picard, and Amé Carré. Close
to Margaret's tomb, behind the altar of the Virgin, is
a beautiful bas-relief deeply cut in white marble,
divided into scenes representing the seven joys of the
Virgin Mary, a masterpiece of carving. In the choir
are the original stained-glass windows, happily uninjured
by time. The figures of Philibert and Margaret
appear in their robes of state with their patron
saints, and are represented kneeling and adoring the
Saviour. Love-knots and marguerites abound in the
mouldings round the windows.</p>

<a href="images/illus367_b.jpg">View larger image</a></p>

<p>In the princess's chapel the stained glass is particularly
rich in colouring, and represents the
Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin by her
Divine Son and God the Father. The apostles below
stand round the empty tomb gazing upwards at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
glorification of the Mother of God. In the lower
lights Philibert and Margaret, richly dressed, kneel
at their prie-dieus, supported by their patron
saints.</p>

<p>On the pavement round Margaret's tomb a few of
the enamelled tiles may still be seen with which
formerly the entire chapel and choir were paved.
Behind the princess's chapel is her private oratory,
which was divided into two stories, with a fireplace
above and below. From her apartments in the
monastery she could enter the church by a passage
across the screen and a hidden staircase, and thus
hear mass and see the elevation of the Host on both
altars, without being seen by those who attended the
services in the church. All these details had been
carefully thought out by the architect, as a letter to
Margaret from her secretary, Louis Barangier, shows.
In November 1512 he wrote to her from Brou: 'As
to your chapels, madame, ... he (Van Boghen) will
make them opposite this building (the monastery), and
intends to construct one which will be a real work of
art, for you will be able to descend from above the
screen ... into your chapel, from which you will
see the high altar over your tomb.' Margaret had
also intended to build a similar oratory in the
prince's chapel, but the executors of her will omitted
to carry out this wish, and the chapel was never
finished, and is now the sacristy.</p>

<p>Beyond Margaret's oratory is the chapel of her
Councillor, Laurent de Gorrevod, Governor of Bresse,
which is dedicated to Our Lady of Pity. It contains
the tombs of Laurent de Gorrevod and his two
wives, Philiberte de la Palud, and Claude de Rivoire,
and several members of their family. The beautiful
recumbent bronze figures of Gorrevod and his wives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
were destroyed at the revolution, and only the slab
on which the statues rested remains, with the founder's
motto&mdash;<i>Pour jamés (jamais)</i>, and the initials
L. F. and L. C. (the letters of his and his wives'
names) joined by the girdle of St. Francis.</p>

<p>Near the south door is the Chapel of Our Lady
of seven sorrows, founded in 1516 by Antoine de
Montécuto, Margaret's confessor and almoner. A
fine painting on a wooden panel, by a Flemish artist,
hangs over the altar, and was one of the sacred
pictures sent by Margaret from Flanders. On the
ground outside the church is a curious sun-dial,
composed of twenty-four stones arranged in a huge
oval, on which are engraved numbers from one to
twenty-four, representing the hours of the day. In
the centre of the oval are twelve stones arranged in
two rows of six each, bearing the initial letters of the
twelve months of the year. In order to tell the
time, the spectator must stand on the letter of the
current month, and his shadow then falls on the hour
of the day, he himself being the index. This interesting
dial dates from the building of the church,
and was probably made for the use of the workmen.
It was formerly placed a little further from the
edifice, and composed of tiles, but, as it was in danger
of being worn away by the constant traffic which
passed over it, Lalande had it moved nearer to the
church, and the worn tiles replaced by slabs of stone,
but carefully preserved the original size and dimensions
of the dial.</p>

<p>When Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> visited Brou on the 1st of October
1541, he was struck by the unique beauty of the church,
though he observed that the white stone of which it
was built was too soft to stand frost, and would in
time crumble away. Paradin, in his <i>Chronique de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Savoie</i>, mentions the king's visit:&mdash;'Je me souviens
aussi,' he says, 'avoir veu descendre le feu roy
François, quand il vint à Bourg, qui après avoir veu
cette esglise restoit ravy en admiration, disant n'avoir
veu ny savoir temple de telle excellence, pour ce
qu'il contenoit. Vray est qu'il se print garde (comme
il esttoit prince excédant en bon esprit tous les rois
de son temps) que ceste pierre blanche, dont est
l'esglise bastie, ne seroit de durée à la gelée, pour
estre trop rare et tendre. Et s'est trouvé depuis qu'il
disoit vray: car long temps après, tombèrent du
quarré du clochier aucuns de ses grans bastions ou
gargoles, qui conduisent les eaues sur le couvert de
l'esglise, du costé des cloistres, chose qui fit grand
dommage au bastiment.'</p>

<p>On the 17th of September 1856 (326 years after
Margaret's death) the entrance to the vault at Brou
was accidentally discovered in raising some flagstones
near Philibert's monument, and on December the 1st
of the same year it was opened in the presence of a
committee of ten persons. Count E. de Quinsonas,
who was present, gives an interesting account of the
visit of inspection. The vault, which had not been
opened since Margaret's coffin had been placed there
in 1532, was entered by a flight of steps from the
choir. The three coffins were found exactly under
their respective monuments in the church above;
Duke Philibert of Savoy's in the centre, Margaret of
Bourbon's on the right, and Margaret of Austria's
on the left. Philibert's coffin was intact, and of a
great length, but those of the two princesses had
broken open, and their remains were scattered on the
floor of the vault. The three coffins rested on iron
trestles.</p>

<p>Margaret of Bourbon's coffin was of lead, shaped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
like an elongated square, but had originally had an
outer coffin of oak, the remains of which lay on the
ground. The princess's skull was intact, and showed
a tress of chestnut hair. The inscription on the
leaden coffin was in French as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">IHS MARIA S</p>

<p class="center">Marguerite de Bourbon<br />
1483<br />
ce 27 Avril fut esevelie.</p>

<p>Philibert's coffin was found in a perfect state of
preservation, in shape similar to that of Margaret of
Bourbon, but of gigantic size. The duke's body had
been placed in an oaken coffin enclosed in lead, which
probably accounted for its preservation; whilst the
two princesses had been laid first in lead and then in
oaken shells, the outer cases of which had rotted
away from the damp, and the inner coffins had
broken open. The following is the inscription on
Duke Philibert's coffin:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#10016; IHS MARIA S</p>

<p class="center">Cy gist, tres excellent et tres puissant prince Philibert.<br />

                  Seign<sup>r</sup> pour luy.</p>

<p>Margaret of Austria's leaden coffin had also
originally been enclosed in one of oak, and was
shaped like a mummy case to the form of the body.
The inscription on the coffin was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p class="center">Hic jacet corpus Dn&#x0304;e Margarete Archiducisse Austrie<br />

                 diem suam clausit extremam anima<br />
                        eius in pace quiescat.</p>

<p>From the bones found in the coffin it was evident
that Margaret, though not tall, was above middle
height. Her skull, with its well-developed forehead,
was covered with bright golden hair, which showed
no trace of grey. The bones of both feet and legs
were intact, proving that no amputation had taken
place.</p>

<p>After reverently collecting the scattered bones of
the two princesses, and placing them in new oaken
coffins, they were temporarily removed until the
necessary cleaning and restoration had been made in
the vault, which had suffered much from damp. On
the 5th of July 1858 they were enclosed in outer
coffins of lead and, with Philibert's coffin, replaced in
their former positions, but on a stone slab which had
been erected to support the three caskets instead of
the iron trestles, which had suffered much from
decay. When all was accomplished a solemn service
was held before the final closing of the vault,
conducted by Cardinal Donnet, Archbishop of
Bordeaux:&mdash;</p>

<p>One wonders what became of such a large number of treasures
and pictures. By Margaret's will, dated 20th of February 1508,
and by the codicils of a later date, she left Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> her sole
heir, but gave her religious pictures to the church of Brou.
The first clause distributed the portraits and pictures throughout
the royal residences of Austria and Spain; the second gave
the others to Brou, where for more than two centuries they
remained until they were plundered by sacriligious hands.</p>

<p>M. Baux, in his description of the church of Brou, has
mentioned a fragment of Margaret's inventory, which he dates
from 1533.</p>

<p>The inventory of 1516 was drawn up by Margaret herself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
and the original, or at least the copy published by M. Le Glay,
gives this same article thus written. The original, written on
parchment and signed by the archduchess herself, is in the
collection said to be the 500 Colbert, in the Bibliothèque
Nationale. M. Le Glay found in the archives at Lille, and
published, an inventory written partly by Margaret and drawn
up partly under her supervision. It would be interesting to
verify if he has not made duplicate copies of pages drawn up
at different times, and which describe the same picture several
times over. The inventory of 1524 is more complete, richer,
and longer.</p>

<p>The description of the following seven objects I have not
noticed in the inventory of 1524:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hanging content">

<h2>A FEW LETTERS</h2>

<p class="p2">Maximilian's letters to Margaret were written in French,
but a kind of French-German jargon. Margaret had been
brought up in France, and had no knowledge of German,
so her father, who knew very little French, was obliged to use
this language in corresponding with her, and often mixed up
French and German words in a most grotesque fashion.</p>

fourteenth century. The following duties were entailed by the holders of
the Order, and by the honour conferred on them they undertook: '(1) To
assist the Dukes of Savoy by word and deed on all occasions that their
assistance was required, and to protect the oppressed. (2) To wear constantly
the collar or chain of the Order, which was composed alternately of
love-knots and the letters F.E.R.T. (3) They were to present to the church
of Pierre-Châtel a chalice, surplice, and all other articles requisite for the
celebration of mass. (4) On their death they were to bequeath 100 livres
for the support of that church. At funerals the whole community were to
be present, dressed originally in white, and later in black cloaks, which,
after the ceremony, they handed over to the Carthusian monks; on all other
occasions the colour of the cloak was crimson, trimmed with fringes and
embroidered with love-knots.'&mdash;(From <i>The Book of Orders</i>, Burke.) Certain
alterations were inaugurated by Charles <span class="smcap">III.</span> of Savoy in 1518, who gave the
Order a new name, 'The Holy Annunciation'; he also added fifteen
enamelled roses, alternating the word 'F.E.R.T.' repeated fifteen times, conjoined
by the girdle of St. Francis, as previously instituted by Amadeus <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>
in the collar in place of the love-knots. Such is the collar worn by Philibert
on his tomb at Brou, as well as in his likeness in the east window. The
meaning of the word 'F.E.R.T.', or the four initial letters, has not been
clearly elucidated. Many interpretations have been suggested; the only
one which seems really probable is that which appears on a gold piece struck
in the reign of Victor Amadeus <span class="smcap">I.</span>, preserved in the medal cabinet of the
Kings of Sardinia: 'Federe et religione tenemur' ('We are united by
honour and religion').&mdash;<i>Notes and Queries</i>, December 6, 1902.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_171" id="Footnote_171" href="#FNanchor_171"><span class="label">[171]</span></a> Printed in Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span>'s letters, it is supposed to have been written in
1512, because it was in this year that the Bishop of Gurce went to Rome.
Besides, in 1511 the emperor was still at war with Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span>, and could
not treat with him with regard to the Pontificate.</p>

<p>(In another letter) Maximilian does not mention getting himself made
coadjutor during the Pope's lifetime, but only obtaining the cardinals' votes
after the Pope's death, who was then seriously ill. Maximilian says
distinctly that the Papacy is inherent to the Imperial dignity, and that he
hopes to have the honour of uniting the Imperial and Papal crowns.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
